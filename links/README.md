# My Archive Of Links

[Main Index](../README.md)

This is the main index page of my archive of links that I consider important enough to archive.

At the moment, all the links are stored on this page, until the number of links increase to a point where I need to break them up into separate sections.

To help prevent 'link rot', [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) links are also provided. Exceptions are:

- links to repositories, e.g. Github, since the content of these can constantly change
- top level link to a group of links
