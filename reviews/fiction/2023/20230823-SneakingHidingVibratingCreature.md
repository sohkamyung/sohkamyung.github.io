*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

More comics on the strange blue aliens that behave like us but don't use words like us. Here, the 'Lifegiver' and 'Offspring' make notes on what a strange furry creature is doing in their home and try to emulate its behaviour, often failing miserably. Until, that is, that figure out what it likes.
