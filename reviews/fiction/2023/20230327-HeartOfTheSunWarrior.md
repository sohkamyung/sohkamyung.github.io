*Rating: 4/5 Stars*

An exciting and emotional conclusion to the story that continues some time after the conclusion of the previous book. Xingyin, the daughter of the Moon Goddess, leads an idyllic existence on the moon with her mother while being assiduously courted by the prince of the Celestial Emperor. But she is also occasionally meeting with the man who betrayed her in the previous book, leading to conflicted feelings in a three-way love triangle.

But that existence swiftly comes to an end when an antagonist moves against her and her family to gain control of an unusual form of magic on the Moon. They are forced to flee and later discover what the magic can do. Old enmities have to be put aside as they put together a desperate plan to get rid of the magic and to stop a madman who may destroy both the mortal and immortal realms.

Much of what takes place in this book (the situations and relationship between Xingyin and various other characters) develops from the previous book, especially her conflicted feelings with the two people who are the most important to her in the book. Her character is further developed and changed as she witnesses the death of people close to her. She is also forced to examine the actions of her father, who caused the death of the sunbirds, beloved of the Sun goddess, to save the Mortal realm as mentioned in the previous book.

In the end, her heart is settled. But in a fitting close, the peace and happiness that she seeks will have to wait for another time.
