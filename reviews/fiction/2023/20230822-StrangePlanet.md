*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

An interesting, and funny series of comics involving blue aliens on another planet who behave like humans, only they use more convoluted language to refer to the same things, behaviours and actions that we would do: like "flying machine's side-portal responsibility zone" for a plane's exit row seat. They mean the same thing, only the aliens' words are, strangely, more correct and funnier.

An enjoyable book, just to see how aliens might refer to the same things and actions we do in a more, well, alien manner.
