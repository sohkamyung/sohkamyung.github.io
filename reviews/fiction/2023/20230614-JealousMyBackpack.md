*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

 A collection of humorous comics strip by Tom Gauld from the early 2010s. Some are pretty funny, like the one that adorns the cover of the book. Others may miss the mark. One of the funniest might feel dated with its reference to a Blackberry, but it still hits the mark with people's obsession with being 'liked' and getting a response on social media, else they will go off and kill themselves.
