*Rating: 4/5 Stars*

A hilarious collection of comics by Tom Gauld, featuring his to-the-point humour on books, libraries and writing in general. Created during the time of lockdowns during COVID-19, the book features lockdown related comics ranging from the humdrum (nothing changed for book writers or readers due to lockdowns) to new ways to cope with reading and writing while unable to leave your home.

The first comic would, of course, feature a view of a future where librarians rise up to take over the world. It is left to the reader to wonder if this is a utopia or a dystopia.
