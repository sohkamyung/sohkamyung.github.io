*Rating: 4/5 Stars*

An enjoyable episode in the Murderbot Diaries, this one continues from where "Network Effect" left off, with a colony left on a world contaminated with alien material that can infect both humans and AI and constructs. In the book, Murderbot and its friends continue to talk to the colonists, hoping to convince them that life with the corporation that is coming to claim their planet is not good (think bonded slavery). Then they learn that there was another colony established and now their job just got twice as tough (or harder).

As if this wasn't enough, Murderbot is suffering from a personal "redacted" problem that is affecting his efficiency. It is only later in this story that the nature of the "redacted" problem becomes clear, and it is something that can also affect humans, which makes Murderbot feel more human (ugh).

The first half of the book is more about subterfuge, as the team try to make contact with the other group of colonists without alerting the corporation. But it may be all for nothing, when the corporation misleads the colonist over what Murderbot's group wants to do. Now, Murderbot reveals what "redacted" is, how it is affecting him and also what he and the group must do to win back the colonist. This, of course, leads to a pitched battle that Murderbot must fight in its own way to win.

Murderbot has also learned that in some ways, he is like the humans he wants to protect. And by the end, who knows where Murderbot and his best friend, ART, will now end up doing.
