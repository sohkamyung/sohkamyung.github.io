*Rating: 4/5 Stars*

A nice anthology of SF (science fiction) from around the world, showing that SF can encompass viewpoints from around the world and is not solely a western phenomenon or told from the viewpoint of a western person. Stories that I especially enjoyed were by Nadia Afifi, Lavanya Lakshminarayan, Isabel Yap, Saad Z. Hossain, Xing He, Nalo Hopkinson, Pan Haitian, Jacques Barcia, Dilman Dila, Bef, Wole Talabi, William Tham Wai Liang, Usman T. Malik, Julie Novakova, T.L. Huchu, Samit Basu and Neon Yang.

- "The Bahrain Underground Bazaar" by Nadia Afifi (Bahrain): an interesting story of an old woman waiting to die from cancer. To pass the time, she visits the Underground Bazaar, to be immersed in the memories of people who have died. But one memory she experiences haunts her, and she must find out more about the person involved. The journey of discovery would change her attitude towards her coming death and her relationship towards her son and daughter-in-law.
- "The Ten-Percent Thief" by Lavanya Lakshminarayan (India): like Robin Hood, the thief wants to rob from the rich, who live in a climate controlled environment, to give to the poor, who survive in what remains of Bangalore. The latest thief would involve not money, but a way to give the poor a glimpse of a better world.
- "At Desk 9501" by Frances Ogamba (Nigeria): one man works in a company that 'saves' people on the verge of death by 'donating' life from the workers. But the man begins to have doubts about his life-saving work when he starts to have dreams about the people he has saved, and those that he couldn't, and the dreams start to bleed over into his reality.
- "Milagroso" by Isabel Yap (The Philippines): in a world where lab-grown food has been apparently perfected and replaced our usual food, one man (who helps produce the lab food) brings his family to a festival in his hometown where a food miracle, caused by a patron saint of food, happens. His reaction to the miracle would cause a conflict in his view that manufactured food is good, and our usual food is bad.
- "Bring Your Own Spoon" by Saad Z. Hossain (Bangladesh): in a future where much of the world's environment is hostile to life, a homeless man and a djinn, woken after a long slumber, dream of opening a 'restaurant' for the less fortunate. At first, their dream comes true as people donate food and other items to be cooked by the man. But then, the dream has to end when the corporations who run what is left of the world take notice.
- "Blue Grey Blue" by Yukimi Ogawa (Japan): in a region selling spectacles for people whose eyes and bodies are coloured, one man, whose eyes can become blue from strong emotions, meets a woman who is interested in his eyes. Only later does he learn the reason for her interest in his eye colour when a drastic colour change happens to his colleague.
- "Your Multicolored Life" by Xing He (China), trans. Andy Dudak: a slave and a revolutionary each escape imprisonment by different sets of machines. They meet and find that a land without run by machines is not to their liking. In the end, they exchange lives to try to live in each other's lands.
- "The Easthound" by Nalo Hopkinson (Jamaica): in a world where becoming an adult turns you into a beast, a group of children survive the best they can. But they are always on the watch for one of their own suddenly changing and, as the story shows, it can happen to anybody at anytime.
- "Dead Man, Awake, Sing to the Sun!" by Pan Haitian (China),  trans. Joel Martinsen: in a world where the walking dead are a reality, some of the dead want to take over the world, but others just want to 'live' quiet lives, waiting for a chance to make that final wish that would finally release them into actual death.
- "Salvaging Gods" by Jacques Barcia (Brazil): in a future when everything is disposed of, a little girl finds the remains of a computing god and brings it back to life. The god begins to grant wishes, but as in all such stories, it does not end well.
- "The Next Move" by Edmundo Paz Soldán (Bolivia), trans. Jessica Sequeira: on an alien world, a soldier fighting an insurgency snaps and begins shooting at anybody he sees. The next move to stop him would be up to a senior officer and an armed observer in charge of a high altitude weapon.
- "The Clay Child" by Dilman Dila (Uganda): an unusual story about a living robot that wants to create a child. Its attempts to gather enough material to do so always fails. Eventually, it goes to a tree that legend has it gave rise to the robots and asks it for help. The tree would indeed help to give it a child, but perhaps one that the robot didn't ask for.
- "To Set at Twilight In a Land of Reeds" by Natalia Theodoridou (Greece): in a future where sentient machines do the harvest on a farm, one person visits to perform some repairs. As the story shows, sentience has enabled machines to bond with people and to also experience loss.

- "The Regression Test" by Wole Talabi (Nigeria): an interesting story about a woman bought in to test an AI that is supposed to be a replica of her famous dead mother. Her test method would reveal that something is not right; but can she hold on to that fact when she discovers that she is in a trap set up to make her pass the AI as her mother.
- "Kakak" by William Tham Wai Liang (Malaysia): a story of an android maid who runs away from the employer. As we learn the story of why she ran away, as well as the story of another android servant abused by people, you may start to wonder if perhaps the androids are more human than the abusers.
- "Beyond These Stars Other Tribulations of Love" by Usman T. Malik (Pakistan): a man wants to continue taking care of his elderly mother, even as he goes on an interstellar trip. The solution would be mind-bending and soul stretching.
- "A Flaw In The Works" by Julie Novakova (Czech Republic), trans. by author: a ship at the edge of the solar system is contacted by aliens. How to respond would be one problem the two aboard the ship have to consider: the other is how to hide who they really are and the tragic events that occurred on Earth in the recent past.

- "Corialis" by T.L. Huchu (Zimbabwe): on an alien world, humans survive by integrating the bacteria from the world in their microbiomes. But it is not enough to ensure their survival, unless they also give and not just take from the environment.

One day, he meets another god and their relationship blossoms in secret. But it would all end when the conquerors need a new god to finish their work. Now the god must decide whether to fight to save his world.
