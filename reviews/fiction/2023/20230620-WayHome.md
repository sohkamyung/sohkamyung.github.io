If you dived into this book, expecting more about Beagle's unicorn, you will be disappointed. Instead, it is a fascinating and moving set of linked stories around the main character, Sooz, and peripherally linked to the world of the unicorn.

The first story, "Two Hearts", republished here, sets the stage. Children in Sooz's village are being hunted by a griffin. Sooz, determined to stop it, disobeys her parents and sneaks away to get the King to come and deal with the griffin. She then bumps into Schmendrick the Magician and Molly Grue, who have their own reasons for seeing the King Lir (for he is the king Sooz is seeking). Seeing the condition the king is in, old and decrepit, Sooz nearly gives up, but upon hearing her request, Lir revives and cannot be stopped from the quest, even if it might mean his death.

The battle with the griffin is fierce, deadly, and would require a last-minute intervention from the unicorn to save the day; but not for one person. Thus, they learn the price for getting rid of the griffin. In closing, Molly Grue gives Sooz instructions that she is only to do when she turns seventeen.

The second, longer story, "Sooz", shows what happens on that day when she executes the instructions. The results are world changing as Sooz discovers a hidden past involving a missing elder sister who has been 'lost' to the 'Dreamies' (fairy folk). She sets out on a quest to find her and to bring her back home.

The quest would be long and involve one brief but violent episode. She also meets an unusual companion who is also on her own quest, but one involving Death. Together, they have to travel through the changing land of the Dreaming, looking for and convincing her sister to come home. But one question they would have to answer is: what is home to them?

A well written story of growing up, discovering secrets, being determined to fulfil your quest, and also learning just who you want to be.
