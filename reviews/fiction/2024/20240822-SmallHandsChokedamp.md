A fascinating detective story involving Isolde Wilby, a police captain with the ability to cast hexes, during her line of work at the Office of Ensorcelled Investigations. During an unrelated investigation, she stumbles upon an unusual magical item: a doll's arm. But she is then forced to release it to a very highly paid lawyer, which makes her curious. Her investigations into the purpose of the arm, and how it might be related to a dispute between a union and a company over high-classed watches, who lead her to discover a form of slavery. And it would need all her wits to finish the investigation.
