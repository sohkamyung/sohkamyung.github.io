*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

A long novel length story from a writer known for writing fascinating, occasionally surreal short fiction, this one involves a group of people suddenly trust back into the world with magic and now have to live with the consequences, some of which are revealed as world changing near the end. This book is not for everyone, as it takes it time with the characters' interactions and situations. But probably a rewarding experience for those who are patient with the author's pacing and revelations.

At the start, three dead teenagers, presumed missing, suddenly reappear in the world and are given form by their music teacher, who turns out to have magic. They are then given the task of finding out how they died, and to eventually learn to control magic, which comes with their reappearance. Things get complicated when another 'spirit' joins them in reappearing in the world, and may have a role in their tasks.

Struggling to re-integrate themselves back into the lives of their families, the author now takes her time showing the interactions that occur, especially with the sister of one of the formerly dead teens. Things take a dark turn when yet another being with magical powers appears, apparently drawn by the reappearance of the teens. She is looking for a missing magical object, and the reappearance of the teens is a sign that it has been found.

Now things take a turn of the worst, as the teens struggle with their new lives, mastering their new magical powers, finding out how they died, and having to deal with a magical being to whom living things are just pawns to be sacrificed once she recovers her lost object.

If the reader pays attention, some of the revelations in the story may not come as a surprise. But the slow pace of the story and the amount of detail the author puts into the interactions between the characters may not sit well with some readers. But those who patiently go through the book may find the conclusion satisfying.
