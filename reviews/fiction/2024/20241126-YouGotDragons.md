*Rating: 4/5 Stars.*

A lovely fairy-tale like story about a dragon exterminator who loves dragons, a princess and a prince who comes calling. Only, the exterminator hates his job, passed down from his father, for he loves dragons and even keeps the smaller ones as pets. The princess is bored with the princes she has to 'interview' as potential partners. And the prince, who fits the physical role of Prince Charming, would rather not try to live up to expectations of his bloodthirsty father who wants to make a 'man' out of him.

They are all thrown together when the princess unexpectedly meets the prince and falls in love (puppy love?). She calls on the exterminator to come to her castle to get rid of the small dragons infesting it before the prince arrives. As for the prince, he decides that he really has to kill a dragon before he can consider himself worthy of asking the princess for her hand in marriage.

But the journey to find a large dragon to kill would darken this fairy-tale when the expedition meets with disaster. An evil wizard will be revealed that has a grudge against the prince's father, and the three would have to work together to try to save the day. In the process, they all discover that they are not meant to fulfill their expected roles in such a fairy tale. But it does have a happy ending, although maybe not the expected one. And, of course, dragons would play a large part in the story.
