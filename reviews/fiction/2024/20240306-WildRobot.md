*Rating: 4/5 Stars.*

A robot gets washed up on the shore of an isolated island and get activated. The robot, known as Roz, is designed to learn and serve humans. But on an island with no humans to serve, Roz does the only thing she can do, learn about the animals, communicate with them and serve them.

It doesn't go well at first, as the animals all avoid Roz. But then an accident lands Roz in the role of a mother to an orphan gosling. Now, Roz asks for advice on how to become a mother, and the animals are more forthcoming and helpful. The gosling thrives and grows up to love Roz.

Roz, in return, has turned into an asset for the island, especially during a very cold winter, where she helps some of the animals survive. But with the return of spring, Roz is finally discovered by humans, and there will be conflict between humans who want their robot back, and the animals who now consider Roz one of them. In the end, Roz has to decide what to do. And thus begins a new adventure for the Roz.

Written in a simplified manner for young children, the book is no 'Disney' version of the wilderness: there is some violence and death on the island. But the heart of the story is Roz's development from a robot built to serve humans into one that serves and help animals instead, and even develops a loving relationship as a mother to a gosling.

Looking forward to reading the further adventures of Roz.
