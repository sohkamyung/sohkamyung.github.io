*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

A book with lovely tales that supplement the author's Celestial Kingdom duology of books. Best read after reading the duology, as the tales contain spoilers for events and the relationships between characters in the book. The book also contains wonderful illustrations of scenes and characters from the book.

The first part of the book contains preview stories showing how Chang-e became the moon goddess. The second part has side-tales that occur in the duology, but told from the viewpoint of other characters from the book, giving us a look at their inner-thoughts. The last part tells what happened during the end of the duology and afterwards, and gives a lovely closure for the main characters from the duology.
