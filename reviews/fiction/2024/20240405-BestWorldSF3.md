*Rating: 4/5 Stars*

Another good anthology of World SF, featuring authors from around the world. As in any anthology with such a wide range of styles, there will be some stories that I didn't like, but it is still valuable by exposing the reader to writers they may never have encountered before. The stories I found interesting were by Diana Rahim, M.H. Ayinde, Luo Longxiang, Thomas Olde Heuvelt, Andrea Chapela, Fadzlishah Johanabas, Efe Okogu, Chen Qian, Choyeop Kim, Eugenia Triantafyllou, Christine Lucas and Pasi Ilmari Jääskeläinen.
