*Rating: 4/5 Stars*

An interesting graphical novel based on the usual 'chosen one' who has to save the world. But this one has a rather big twist towards the end, and you may start to wonder whether she has been chosen to really save the world or to destroy it.

In the story, the world as we know it ended in the year 2000, when electricity failed and magic began to work. Trouble is, nobody knew how to control magic at the time, leading to catastrophic spells being cast. Now, many years later, stable magical regions of the world exist, but a dark magic is creeping out, slowly devouring the regions.

Into this steps one special girl who has been trained by his grandfather (now a powerful wizard) to be the Chosen One to gather magical items for him so he can cast a spell to save the world. But clues left throughout the story hint that something is not quite right with her journey: as if she is being led to a foregone conclusion. It is only resolved with a massive twist at the end and now, it is truly up to her (and her friends) to come together and really try to save the world.
