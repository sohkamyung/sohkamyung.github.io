*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

An interesting story involving a sin-eater, a person who eats the sins of a newly dead person, so that the dead person won't have a reason to return from the dead. In this story, she has to eat the sins of a friend, but things don't turn out as expected: she gets called to the underworld by her friend to do one final task for her. Agreeing to the task would cause a disruption to both the living and the dead that can only be resolved by a confrontation.
