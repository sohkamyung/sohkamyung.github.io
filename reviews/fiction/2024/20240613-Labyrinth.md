*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

On an Earth that is being ravaged by unknown forces, slowly poisoning the atmosphere and the surface, the survivors hide out in underground bases, occasionally wandering out to the surface. The story concerns one expedition, two siblings and a teenage kid, who go on an expedition to collect samples while trying to keep the kid distracted and entertained.

But something is definitely wrong, when the kid begins behaving in a fashion that terrifies the adults. All is finally revealed when the world slowly begins to end and the horrible things the survivors did to survive are shown in both words and illustrations, ending with one shocking illustration that shows just what trying to survive has done to the survivors.
