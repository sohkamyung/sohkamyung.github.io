*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

The next instalment involving Roz the Wild Robot, this one shows more of the world that Roz inhabits. The story itself, while exciting, is not quite as interesting as the previous two, as Roz is more of a spectator in the climax of the story, but the ending is nicely done.

In this story, Roz's island is engulfed in a 'poison tide' that forces the inhabitants inland, and fight for their survival. Roz discovers that her new body has abilities the previous one did not, and sets out to find the source of the poison and stop it. To do that, she will first have to journey to the far north to find the Ancient Shark and get its advice.

The long journey reveals a world already in the grip of climate change, with scenes of flooded towns that Roz journeys through. As before, the journey will also find Roz making new friends with animals. After she finds the Ancient Shark and the source of the poison, Roz will try to stop it in her own way. But in the end, she discovers the way to stop the poison tide may be out of her hands.
