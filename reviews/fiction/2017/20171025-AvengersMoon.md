*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

An interesting book about the (first) adventure of Curt Newton (who takes on the name Captain Future). Raised on the moon by a self-aware android, robot and a brain encased in a drone, he learns who murdered his parents and sets out to avenge them. But as he is about to get his act of revenge, he gets pulled into a plot to assassinate the President of the Solar System. And now he has a new mission: to discover who is behind the assassination attempt.

Using characters from the Edmond Hamilton version of Captain Future, while updating the people, technology and the physical aspects of the Solar System, Steele puts together a pretty good story. Some background information is dumped on to the reader but otherwise, the story flows pretty smoothly, starting with how the Newtons get to the moon to the climactic finale on Mars, where Curt has to make some pretty big sacrifices to save his life and those of his companions from the clutches of the Magician of Mars, Ul Quorn.

There are enough left-over elements by the end to make up more stories about Captain Future. We'll just have to see if this is a one-off or whether Steele plans to write more stores about the updated version of Captain Future.
