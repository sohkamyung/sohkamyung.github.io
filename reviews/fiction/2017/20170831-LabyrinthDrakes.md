*Rating: 4/5 Stars.*

The build up is starting to pay off in this series. Events mentioned in the previous books come together in this book satisfyingly, leading to more questions that may be answered in the final book of the series.

In this book, the secret behind the bones of dragons is out. In an attempt to ensure wild dragons are not slaughtered into extinction for their bones, Isabella reluctantly helps her country's military force to try to breed dragons, so that at least wild ones will be safe. The attempt would take her to the country where a certain gentleman she met and worked with while on the Basilisk (the previous book) resides, leading to all sorts of uncomfortable questions.

But that is a sideshow at first: for she and the site used for dragon breeding comes under attack from saboteurs. And then she would need to enter the infamous Labyrinth of Drakes (a maze of canyons) to continue her studies on dragon breeding. For that to happen, she must settle her relationship with the gentleman; which she does in a spectacular manner.

But enduring the hardships of the Labyrinth to study dragons would only be the start. For she and her companions would make a startling discovery in the Labyrinth that would answer some of the questions about the mysterious 'dragon people' of prehistory and raise new ones.

Some questions answered; new ones raised. The series is becoming very interesting and there is only one more book to come. That should well be a very interesting book to read.
