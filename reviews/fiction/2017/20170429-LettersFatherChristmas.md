*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

An interesting little book about the letters Father Christmas would write to J. R. R. Tolkien's children. The true author is not mentioned but a look at the script of the letters, included in the book, hint at who actually wrote them.

The letters tell of the various adventures and misadventures of Father Christmas and other folk at the North Pole, mainly involving the Polar Bear with occasional bouts of fighting with goblins who are mainly after Father Christmas' mechanical toys.

Polar Bear would occasionally write a letter, but he is more usually interjecting comments into the letters, leading to some humorous back-and-forth commentary between Polar Bear and Father Christmas as they both give their sides of the story.

The letters reproduced in the book are excellent, showing the colourful script used as well as the sketches and drawings that accompany the letters. Hobbits do get a mention in one letter.

A nice look at the fatherly side of JRR Tolkien.
