"Age of the Wolf" is a three-part werewolf story by Alec Worley and Jon Davis-Hunt. It is told from the viewpoint of Rowan Morrigan. At the start, most of humanity is transformed into werewolves. Rowan discovers that she is being hunted, for she is part of a prophecy that would see werewolves driving humans extinct unless she can stop it. At the end of the first part, she fulfils (or does she?) the prophecy.

In the second part, years have passed. Humanity still survives (barely) and Rowan leads a band of survivors hoping to find a safe place. But she is opposed by another band of survivalists who sell fellow humans and has a grudge against her. After much tragedy, Rowan escapes with a baby to safety.

In the last part, many years have passed. The werewolves themselves have changed and become intelligent creatures, intent on harnessing magical powers to ensure that humanity is wiped out. But that requires a sacrifice, specifically, the baby (now a woman) rescued by Rowan. Rowan herself is now weaker, but intends to save humanity any way she can, even if it requires sacrificing those that she loves.

This story was apparently based on an ancient Norse prophecy of Ragnar√∂k, in which most of humanity become werewolves. How much it follows and deviates from it is left to the reader as an exercise. The situation features runes and ancient British and Irish forms of magic. The artwork is coloured, dramatic, and somewhat bloody (can't be helped: it's a werewolf story).
