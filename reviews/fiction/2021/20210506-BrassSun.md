*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

An interesting 2000AD graphic novel. Here, the protagonist, Wren, lives on a planet that is part of a huge orrery, a mechanical solar system. But all is not right. The Brass Sun at the heart of the system is running down and cooling and already, the outermost worlds have gone cold. Wren is tasked with gathering parts of a key distributed among the worlds (to prevent one one from dominating another) to restart the Brass Sun.

As she makes her journey through orrery to other worlds, she learns of her system's actual past, about a catastrophe that befalls mankind and the remaking our solar system into the worlds of the Brass Sun and of a being who wants to end it all and is now in pursuit of her.

This book is only the first part of the entire story and ends on a question mark over whether she will complete her task or not.
