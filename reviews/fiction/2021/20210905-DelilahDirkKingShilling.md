*Rating: 4/5 Stars.*

An exciting sequel in the continuing adventures of Delilah Dirk and her sidekick, Selim. After helping a Portuguese family (in the midst of the war between British and French forces), Delilah is captured and accused of being a French spy by a British officer. She escapes, discovers clues that point to the actual spy and has to actually return to England to clear her name, much to the delight of Selim.

Delilah's reluctance to return to England and ask the help of her family (and military connections) form part of the puzzle that Selim has to figure out, while trying to keep up the pretence that Delilah Dirk isn't a swashbuckling heroine he knows her to be in the family's presence. It all comes to a climax when the spy's plot is revealed, and there is no time for niceties as Delilah races to stop the spy's plot to sink England's plans to stop the French in Portugal and Spain.

An exciting sequel with lots of good humour, in the family situation, as well as swashbuckling and fighting action as she takes on the spy at the climax of the story.
