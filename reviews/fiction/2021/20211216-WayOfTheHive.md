*Rating: 4/5 Stars.*

An interesting and fun graphic novel on the life of the honey bee. The story focuses on the life of one bee, Nyuki, who starts off as a grub asking lots of questions to her elder sister about what is going to happen to her during metamorphosis when she turns into an adult bee.

After she becomes an adult, she gets involved in a bee swarming event to look for a new home. She then ventures by herself outside the hive before she is ready, leading to adventures with other creatures. Once she makes it back, she declares that she has had enough of the outside world and devotes herself to hive activities.

But a crisis event would lead her to venture back out to help her elder sister. The final part of the book shows a now elderly Nyuki, now leading her younger sisters. But as her life slowly ebbs away, she has one final plan to ensure that her legacy remains with the bees' nest.

An anthropomorphic story, this is also an educational look at the life of honey bees, that is full of laughs. However, the ending may be a bit emotional for younger readers.
