*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

A quiet, little tale of life for a Mooncop: finding lost teenagers, filing regular reports on crimes (none), finding a lost dog and a lost lunar automaton and discovering the automated snack dispenser is being replaced by a manned donut shop. All against a background of a lunar colony slowly winding down as people leave for another life back on earth. Should he leave, or perhaps admire the lovely view on the moon for a while longer.

Drawn in Tom Gauld's usual detailed style, there is some humour to be found in the story of a cop doing his job the best he can given the circumstances.
