A wonderful variation on the story of Chang'e. Here, Chang'e is an immortal bound to the moon but what she keeps hidden from the Celestial rulers is her daughter, Xingyin, who lives a free life on the moon hidden from others apart from their servant. But it all ends one day, when Xingyin's magical powers manifest itself and is detected as a magical disturbance by the Empresses. She has no choice but to try to escape, but ends up in the Celestial Kingdom. There, her adventures begin.

She ends up becoming a learning companion of the Crown Prince and a skilled archer in the army. She discovers a possible way for her to free her mother from being bound to the moon. Furthermore, she also discovers herself falling in love and getting her heart broken. Thus, begins her life in the army as she battles monsters and enemies to finally earn the right to free her mother, but only if she does one final task: a task that she does not really want to fulfil. It is while trying to do the final task that her heart and mind come into conflict, and she has to make life-changing decisions that could result in her death and the death of the people she loves.

Written in first-person, we see the world as Xingyin and live through her emotions, thoughts, accomplishments and failures as she learns skills and make decisions towards her goal of being reunited with her mother and freeing her from the moon.

Now looking forward to reading the second book and the further adventures of Xingyin.
