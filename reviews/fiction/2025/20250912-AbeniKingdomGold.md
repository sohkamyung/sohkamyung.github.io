*Rating: 4/5 Stars.*

An exciting second part in the series. Abeni and her spirit friends continue their journey to find help to fight the Witch Priest, who is determined to conquer the world. But their journey is interrupted when they stumble into the Kingdom of the Gold Weavers, and have to go on a quest to save them from the Witch Priest.

The quest would start off with enmity between Abeni and the haughty princess of the Kingdom who joins them. But when both Abeni and the princess both lose something precious, their relationship would change and by the end, they would all realise that they need to help one another if they are to save the Gold Weavers and thwart the plans of the Witch Priest. But the Witch Priest has his own plans, one that would involve his adopted daughter hunting for Abeni and helping him to take control of the Gold Weavers.

While the first book was more of a tale of discovery for Abeni, this one is more of a usual quest-adventure for her, learning more about the world, making new friends and discovering that she may have to fulfil a destiny: but that will have to wait for another book, as saving the Gold Weavers is the main plot driving this story.
