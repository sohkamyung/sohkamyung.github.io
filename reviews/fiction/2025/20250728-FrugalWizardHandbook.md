*Rating: 4/5 Stars.*

An entertaining book about the adventures of a man who ends up in England in a pocket universe with no memory of why he is there, with only the remains of a Frugal Wizard's Handbook to guide him.

As he gradually regains his memory, he gets involved in a quest to save the region from gangsters and an invasion, and learns more about himself and the world. Along the way, he makes some friends, shows off his powers (enhanced by technology from his own time) and discovers the truth about himself as his memory fully returns. But it is what he does from then on that will determine the future of the world he has landed in. And the world itself it not without some interesting features not found in our world.

The book contains interesting 'dramatic' illustrations and excerpts from the Handbook to guide the reader. It also an alternate quest in the marginalia involving a small wizard who also enters a pocket universe, only to alter it in unexpected ways.
