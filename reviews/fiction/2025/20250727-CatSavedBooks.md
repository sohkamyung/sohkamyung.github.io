*Rating: 4/5 Stars.*

An interesting story about the relationship between an introvert boy and a cat that can talk, and their adventures in saving books. And while saving the books, he (and the reader) will get a better appreciation about the power of books to affect the world.

At the start, the boy's grandfather, who owns a small bookshop, has passed away, leaving the boy feeling isolated and alone. The boy may have to close the bookshop, his comfort space, to stay with his relatives. But then a talking cat shows up, asking for his help to save books. Together, they journey to three labyrinths, where books are being imprisoned, mutilated and sold as commodities. Using his knowledge and love about books, the boy works to free the books and to convince the people in the labyrinth to love books for what they are, not for what the person can do to the books.

During the adventures, the boy gradually begins to open up and develops a friendship with a school classmate, who is concerned about him not showing up in school. The classmate, unexpectedly, then joins in his adventures.

But there is one more labyrinth, which the boy has to enter on his own. For it contains a formidable opponent with a strong opinion about books. And it would need all the boy's love, and thoughts, about books to change the opponent's opinion about the power of books and what books can do.

In the end, the adventures will convince the boy to open up to the world and to keep the bookshop open; for there will always be a need for books. As for the cat, it will move on to other adventures.
