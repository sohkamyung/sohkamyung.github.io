*Rating: 4/5 Stars.*

Set in the world of the author's "Six Crimson Cranes" series, this is a prequel that tells the story of the early life of the stepmother in the series. Channari, the elder of two sisters, was left in the jungle by her father as an offering to a witch to keep her mother alive after giving birth to her younger sister, Vanna. But it backfired, for the witch wanted the younger sister. Instead, Channari returned, but with a scaly snake-like face that forever marked her and isolated her from her community, with only her younger sister as a friend. And she swore she would keep her younger sister safe, for she knows the witch will come for Vanna, for the witch desires the inner light from her younger sister's heart.

Years past and as Vanna grows up, her glowing inner light brings fame and royalty from surrounding islands asking for her hand. Channari gets separated from Vanna during a selection ceremony and fights to return to her side. In this, she is aided by her childhood snake friend and a half-dragon, half-demon fighter whom she has to trust. But the witch has also come; and during the final confrontation, trust and betrayal would turn Channari into the person she would be in the "Six Crimson Cranes" series.

A story of the powerful bond between two sisters who would not be separated despite the ugliness of one and the magical heart of the other.
