*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

Another interesting book in the series that reveals more about the world of the Hexologists. But the plot meanders over the landscape, with some abrupt shifts that give the reader a hint of what is happening. And it requires a number of 'info dumps' before the true nature of what the Hexologists are facing becomes clear.

In the story, Isolde and Warren Wilby investigate the murder (or apparent suicide) of an artist who is suspicious of the hexes that the artist is putting into her latest artwork. The investigation would lead them to suspect that some unknown person may be 'pulling the strings' of magic that runs through the world, altering it in ways to prevent them from solving the case.

In the end, it would require a desperate battle between Isolde and the character to determine the outcome that would have world changing consequences for all of them.
