*Rating: 4/5 Stars.*

A fascinating collection of stories by a writer concerned with the impact of AI technology, and how cultures and other races are often overlooked or looked down upon by those in the west. Some stories here are standalone, while some form part of a series or are related to each other thematically as a form of 'future history'.

- Ghost Days (2013): a story told in different times and different places: a genetically modified human living on an alien world, a possibly illegal refugee in the USA, and the refugee's grandparents in China. What ties them together is an object passed down from person to person in the story, and a shared feeling about not belonging to the place.
