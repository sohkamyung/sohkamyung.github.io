*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

An interesting satirical fantasy story about archaeologists looking at fragments of a story about an abandoned city called Bovadium, which turns out to be Oxford, and how it fell due to the devilish motorcars that gradually enslave the inhabitants of the city, eventually causing its downfall.

J. R. R. Tolkien initially intended to publish the story but put it aside when comments by friends indicated that the language used and satire might go over the head of readers. It was finally published by his son, along with notes and background information that lead to the writing of the story.

It was written at a time when Tolkien was at Oxford, and Oxford itself became a centre of car manufacturing for Morris cars. As the car population at Oxford grew, congestion became a fact of life. One solution was to build a road across a green area in Oxford, a controversial solution which became a battle between those advocating and opposed to the idea, which Tolkien was aware of.

The story itself has the feel of a fable, one that people who own and drive cars in congested areas will be familiar with. Whether we will all end up as Bovadium in the end is up to the reader to decide.
