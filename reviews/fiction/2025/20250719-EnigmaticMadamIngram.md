*Rating: 4/5 Stars.*

A fantastical tale that further expands the world inhabited by Miss Cassidy. Goddesses and female spirits (and the occasional male ones) from various western and Asian pantheons mix in this story about the relationship between a terrible spirit that wants to be loved by her 'daughters' and her daughters desire for their freedom from her. Into this conflict steps Miss Cassidy and her mortal 'companion', Mr. Kay, whose efforts may help to resolve it; or not.

Unlike the previous book, which is a linear tale mainly told from Miss Cassidy's viewpoint, this one is multilayered in both time (past and present) and with multiple viewpoints. It starts off with the first person viewpoint of Madam Ingram, who travels to Singapore to find Madam Kay (the daughter of Mr. Kay) for help with her ailment that has caused her to be labelled a madwoman in the west. The story then skips backwards in time as Madam Ingram starts recalling her past life with her mother and father, including events that she has strangely forgotten about.

The story then alternates with third person viewpoints from Miss Cassidy and Mr. Kay. As the story develops, it turns out that Miss Cassidy has encountered Madam Ingram and her mother in the past, while Mr. Kay is pulled into the half-world between the mortal and spiritual realms in an effort to resolve the mystery around a bizarre dancing spirit that may be related to Madam Ingram.

As the past (and present) slowly comes into focus for Madam Ingram, Miss Cassidy and Mr. Kay, it becomes apparent that they are facing a possessive and powerful spirit that wants her daughters to return to her and will not let Miss Cassidy (or others) get in her way. It would require all the help Madam Ingram can get from Miss Cassidy, Mr. Kay and others to face her mother and decide her own fate.

While the main tale is mysterious and grim in the telling, the atmosphere of the book itself is light-hearted and humorous, especially the bantering between Mr. Kay and Miss Cassidy. The goddesses featured in the book also inject some fun in the story via their interactions with Miss Cassidy. In this world, there are rules about how the various gods, goddesses and spirits can interact with each other and with the human world: breaking (or bending) the rules will eventually land Miss Cassidy in a lot of trouble.

By the end, the tale would involve journeys to the British Isles, France and India before returning to Singapore to focus on the final confrontation. It would also (somewhat unexpectedly) involve characters and situations encountered by Miss Cassidy in the first book, before being resolved in a manner that would leave both mother and Madam Ingram content with the resolution.

This is a story that starts with a mystery and ends with a mighty resolution that, of course, sets things up for the third part of the series.
