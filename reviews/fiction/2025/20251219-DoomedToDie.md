*Rating: 4/5 Stars.*

A fun little book that honour J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth by illustrating and rhyming about the deaths that feature in the books. It starts with "A is for Arwen, done in by sorrow." and ends with Z, one of the more notable deaths in the books.

The A-Z list is followed by a note from the author about how the book got started. Then an appendix is given, showing how each death was illustrated, along with information about the character featured in the death. This is helpful for general readers not familiar with the works of Tolkien, and may persuade them to read the books to find out more about the character themselves.
