*Rating: 4/5 Stars.*

An interesting fantasy story involving a puppet maker with some magical ability over her puppets, set in a city that is strongly divided into the upper class (who control magic in the city) and the rest (who have to get by with the bits of magic that can be found) that is ruled by gangs. The puppet maker has a secret relationship with magical puppets that were bought to life by magic in the past: she makes new puppets for them (which are then made alive by magic), and they help her survive in the city by thievery.

But then, a gang lord calls her in, for his gang have found a hidden lair that contains an unusual object, and they use her to learn more about it. But what she discovers could change the entire power structure of the city and her relationship with the magical puppets.
