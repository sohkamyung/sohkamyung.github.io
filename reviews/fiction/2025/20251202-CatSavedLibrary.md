*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

The cat with an unusual connection with books returns. Here, it teams up with a girl suffering from asthma whose favourite activity is reading books from the library. Her familiarity with the library is what makes her realise that something is wrong: books are disappearing from the library.

One day, she sees an unusual grey man in the library and when she investigates, discovers a number of Arsène Lupin books are missing. Following the man is where she meets up with the cat and discovers the books being guarded in a castle guarded by grey soldiers. Confronting the grey man, she learns that not only has he been with humanity for a long time, but is working to 'free' men from the influence of books.

While rescuing the books from the grey man is a major objective for the girl, it would turn out to be the girl's relationship with books, the cat, her father (and with characters from the previous book) that would point the way to lessen the impact the grey man would have on humanity.
