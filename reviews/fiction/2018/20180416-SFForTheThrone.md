*Rating: 4/5 Stars*

An interesting collection of short-short stories, each can be read in one seating on the 'throne'. The stories are grouped together based on a common theme, with each story ending with a note about the author.

Of the stories in the collection, the ones that I found thought-provoking and interesting include those by Kristine Kathryn Rusch, James L. Cambias, Lawrence Watt-Evans, Steven Popkes, David Brin, Cat Rambo, Robert Dawson, Nancy Kress, Bud Sparhawk and James Van Pelt. These stories manage to invoke the feeling that the stories are just a glimpse into bigger stories full of fascinating possibilities.

===

- "Stand-In" by Gregory Benford: aliens blend into human society via fictional personalities
