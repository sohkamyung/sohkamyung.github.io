*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

The next instalment of the Secret Coders series. Here, the trio learn more about the background of a previous set of coders, including Hopper's father, and how they managed to thwart the plans of one coder who turned bad.

But then the Dean of the school forces the coders to open a portal, revealing a powerful turtle and then proceeds to take them to the hideout of the evil mastermind, Professor One-Zero and his plans to turn all of humanity into one big happy family.

It is up to the coders, who have upgraded their coding skills with loops, function parameters and multiple decisions (if-then-else), to thwart his plans before Professor One-Zero blasts the town.
