*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

The fifth book in the Secret Coders, series, this one continues their battle against the evil Professor One-Zero who plans to use the controlling potion he's manufactured to control the town, and it's up to the coders to stop him with the help of some programming.

The book makes a digression into the history of Professor Bee, showing where he came from and how his arrival here lead to the creation of his school, via interactions with some famous computer scientists that originally created the Logo programming language.

The book ends with instructions from Professor Bee to return to his home and obtain an item that may be the only way to ultimately stop Professor One-Zero.

As with the rest of the books in the series, the reader is asked to accomplish simple coding tasks before proceeding, and is then shown what the pieces of code do. Drawing with multiple loops as well as a command to draw circles (up to now, coding could only be done with straight lines) are introduced.

The next book in the series is the concluding one and promises to be an interesting showdown.
