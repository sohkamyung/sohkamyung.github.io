*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

An entertaining collection of comics by Tom Gauld, who mostly creates cartoons for the Guardian. By mainly playing with (and skewering) common tropes in books (mainly literary, science fiction or fantasy works), Gauld shows some of the absurdities that we accept as 'just the way things are done' in society.

Some comics play with literary conventions, like imagining how the characters in novels think about sex, or going on various fantasy quests while knowing most of them won't make it to the end due to the whims of authors. Other comics give humorous (and occasionally apocalyptic) views of society by playing the 'if this goes on' game.

Overall, a good collection that never fails to get a laugh for those looking for humour that pokes fun at the more literary aspects of society.
