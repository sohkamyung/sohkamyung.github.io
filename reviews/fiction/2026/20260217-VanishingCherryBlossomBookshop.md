*Rating: 4/5 Stars.*

A series of stories that involves an unusual bookshop that can only be accessed at a certain time when the proprietor of the shop reads a book at the same time as a person. But the person who enters the shop gets to access information that lets them accept what has happened in their life and to move on.

The first story involves a girl who is settling the funeral matters of her estranged mother. In the process, she discovers why her mother was so frugal with money and so demanding of her children. But it requires a visit with the bookshop to learn how much their mother loved her and wanted her to be her own person.

The second story involves an elderly former train driver who is suffering from memory loss, especially the memory of what his beloved late wife once said to him. A visit to the shop reveals what she once said to him, and helps him accept his situation and to connect with his family again.

The third story involves two twin sisters, one of who is now leaving the family home. On their last day together, but a visit to the shop who show them that a disagreement over events involving an old acquaintance is not what it appears to be, bringing them closer together.

The last story is unusual: a visit to the shop by a woman, which would affect the shop itself via a book written by the woman's father. And in an interesting circular plot point, would involve the woman from the first story.
