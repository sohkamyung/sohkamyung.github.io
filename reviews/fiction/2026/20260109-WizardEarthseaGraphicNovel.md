*Rating: 4/5 Stars.*

A remarkable adaptation into graphic form of Ursula K. Le Guin's book. The author notes that much of the text from the original novel is preserved here, but layered on is artwork that evokes the world of Earthsea.

The adaptation tells the story of a young wizard who has a strong affinity for magic. He comes to the attention of a mage when he uses strong magic to save his village from an invasion, who gives him his true name: Ged. In Earthsea, true words have magical power and wizards are trained to use words, but in a sparing manner, for the balance between light and dark must be maintained.

But Ged is impatient to learn magic. He eventually goes to a school to learn about magic and is a quick learner. But his pride gets the better of him, and he shows off his magical skills. But this ends up summoning a shadow that attacks him. Recovering from the attack, he learns that the shadow has no name and is hunting for him. Mastering his pride, Ged goes on several adventures involving dragons and other dark forces in the world, before he goes on to confront the shadow.

A fascinating fantasy story about a world and the journey one person makes to grow up ready to confront his fears. The graphic novel also helps bring to Earthsea to visual life.
