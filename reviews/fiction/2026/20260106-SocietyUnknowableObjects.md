*Rating: 4/5 Stars.*

A fascinating book involving a Society set up to hide away magical Unknowable Objects to prevent them from being misused. They meet every six months, but it has been years since a magical object has been found: until now. Magda Sparks goes to get it, but she encounters a professional killer who has his own reasons for hunting magical objects. The result is a race between Magda (and her friends) and the killer for the objects.

And then, an unusual person with an affinity for magical objects steps into the story, a twist that reveals that the Society of Unknowable Objects that Magda knows is not what it seems. It also reveals the truth behind the magical objects and the unusual person: and Magda may be the only one who can prevent the world from being destroyed by magic, even if the solution is one that she does not like.

There is a link between this book and the author's previous one, "The Book of Doors", but it is hinted at when the source of the magical objects is revealed.
