*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

In this second book of Zita's adventures, she is now famous. But she finds fame boring and yearns to return home. Then, an encounter with a robot that can look like her gives her a chance to escape fame for a while. But that encounter would lead to danger for a planet looking for a hero to save it and to Zita being labeled a criminal.

Initially, Zita is selfish, only thinking of freedom. But when others act to sacrifice themselves to save her from capture, she finally decides to become the hero that others want her to be. But that act itself may be the end of Zita. And even if she survives being a hero, there is still the criminal act hanging over her. That will only be resolved in the third book.

Once again, another exciting book by Ben Hatke on the adventures of Zita.
