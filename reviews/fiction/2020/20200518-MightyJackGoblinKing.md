*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

Jack's sister has been kidnapped by Giants and it is up to Jack and his friend Lilly to rescue her from the world they now find themselves in, created by the plants that Jack and his sister planted in the previous book. Among the perils they face is the Goblin King and the machine that Giants run to keep up their rule that must devour a human or explode.

A story full of impulsive action, heroism, friendships and sacrifices that have to be done to save a world. But it's not over yet for Jack when he discovers he has to team up with another at the end to save the world.
