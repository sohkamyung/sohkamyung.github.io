*Rating: 4/5 Stars*

A fascinating and humorous story about the women who have the ambition to go to space. The book initially starts with Valentina Tereshkova's journey into space but then switches over to cover some of the women in the US who set out to break barriers to become not just astronauts with scientific roles in space, but to also become pilot and commanders of space missions.

Most of the rest of the book covers Mary Cleave, who not only became an astronaut, but went on to become a NASA administrator who ensured that women and other minorities would become represented in the US astronaut corps.
