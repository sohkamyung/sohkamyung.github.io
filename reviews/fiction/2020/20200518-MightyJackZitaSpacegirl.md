Two people and their companions have to unite to save the Earth from an invasion of Giants. But can they, when rivalries and jealousies threaten to break them up until they learn to work together.

The interesting conclusion to two series bought together by the author. But a number of sequences and settings in it are best enjoyed by the reader who is familiar with the previous Zita the Spacegirl series by the author.
