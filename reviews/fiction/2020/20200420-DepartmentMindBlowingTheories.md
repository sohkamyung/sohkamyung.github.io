*Rating: 4/5 Stars*

A collection of wonderful, quirky and funny cartoons by Tom Gauld that poke gentle fun at the field of science. It also skewers various tropes about scientists (like 'the mad scientist' or the 'oops, I didn't mean to do that') which still showing why scientists can sometimes be so maddeningly single-minded about getting some done (or undone).

Best read for those who know something about science and scientists. Some of the more technically minded cartoons may confuse some readers but you will still enjoy looking at the angular artwork featured in the book.
