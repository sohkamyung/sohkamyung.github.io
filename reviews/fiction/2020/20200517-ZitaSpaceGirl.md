*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

One day, Zita and her friend find an unusual meteorite with a strange object. Upon pressing it, they are thrown far away to another world where Zita must rescue her friend, make new friends, save the world and then return home. Quite a lot of things to do for a new space traveler.

An entertaining graphic novel about the adventures of Zita, although left unsaid is why the object was there in the first place to be found by her or why the aliens on the planet, despite their technological superiority to us, can't save their own planet the old-fashioned way (with technology) but must rely on a prophecy that her friend must somehow fulfill.

Perhaps future adventures of Zita will answer those questions.
