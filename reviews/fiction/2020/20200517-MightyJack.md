*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

An interesting start of a new series by Ben Hatke which is a re-telling of the Jack and the Beanstalk story. But here, Jack has a sister who doesn't talk, whom he has to take care of for the summer while their mother is off working at two jobs. One day at a fair, they encounter a strangely familiar character who offers them seeds. Anybody would turn down the offer; but not Jack because his sister convinces him to take the seeds.

Thus begins their planting adventures as the seeds give birth to strange creatures and magical powers ... and draws a dragon into their world. But the dragon warns them that danger lurks in the garden. And danger does appear in the form of a particular packet of seeds that, when planted, kidnaps Jack's sister. And thus begins his adventures to rescue her.
