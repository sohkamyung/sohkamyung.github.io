*Rating: 4/5 Stars*

The Murderbot arc of stories concludes for now with Murderbot returning to his clients in the first story, only to find their leader kidnapped and held for ransom by the company to force them to drop the case against the company. In the race to rescue her, Murderbot calls attention on itself, and now the company wants it for the information it has on the company on the alien synthetic artefacts that the company has been secretly digging up (and murdering people to keep them quiet about it).

With lots of drama, suspense and, of course, mayhem, Murderbot puts its rescue plan into action. But its major problems will not be with the company but with its former clients. For rescuing and interacting with them has put Murderbot's main questions front and centre: what does it really want to do (besides watch entertainment shows). By the end of the story, it still hasn't really decided but for now, its future is in its hands and it doesn't have to worry that it will end up as a 'pet robot' (its main worry).
