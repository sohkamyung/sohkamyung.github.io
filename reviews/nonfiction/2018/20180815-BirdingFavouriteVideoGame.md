*Rating: 4/5 Stars*

A funny and entertaining collection of comics originally published on the [Bird and Moon website](https://rosemarymosco.com/comics/bird-and-moon). The information contained in most of the comics are factual, but they are presented in an entertaining way that will make them stick in your mind.

But not all the comics are funny; those dealing with environmental degradation and climate change are definitely not meant to be funny, but are thoughtfully presented.

You will definitely learn something new from the various comics in the book. The website is, of course, still worth visiting for new comics not featured in the book.
