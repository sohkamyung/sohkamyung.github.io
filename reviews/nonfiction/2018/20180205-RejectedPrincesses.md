*Rating: 4/5 Stars*

An excellent book about various "Heroines, Hellions, and Heretics" that have romped through the history of the world. Some are celebrated in their countries, others are forgotten, while others have had their history (re)written by others. Some are real, others may have been real (or are amalgamations of several women) while some are mythical.

Originally started as a dare to see who can come out with the character most unlikely to be featured as a 'Disney Princess', the author has put them into this book, accompanied by illustrations depicting the life of each character.

In one way or another, each character in the book has made their mark in the world. But the book is not all sweetness and victory: some of the women have been viciously abused (or are abusers) and violence is a near constant feature of the entries.

But you will learn some fascinating facts about these women. The author includes numerous references, some of which the author admits do not make for easy reading.

All in all, an entertaining and educational book that shows that women have made their mark in history; it is only that that current day media outlets have tended to ignore their efforts: something that this book, and many others, are now trying to change by telling their stories and making sure the world knows about them.
