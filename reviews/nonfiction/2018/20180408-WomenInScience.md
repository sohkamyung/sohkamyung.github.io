*Rating: 4/5 Stars*

A fascinating book about fifty women who overcame various odds to make their mark in the scientific field. Nice illustrations of the women are featured, which include little titbits that highlight particular points about the women's lives.

Most people will have probably heard about some of the more prominent women featured here, like Marie Curie, Jane Goodall or Valentina Tereshkova. While the others are possibly less well known to the public, they are equally noteworthy.

A common theme that runs through the stories of the women are the obstacles put into their path: being denied an education, being treated as less intelligent than men or denied opportunities (much less equal opportunities to men). The women overcome them and their importance has become recognized (for some, after their deaths).

Mainly aimed at younger readers (although the stories should also be eye-openers to adults), the stories show that you shouldn't judge the ability of a person based on their gender or their background.
