*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

An interesting book that collects the thoughts and feelings of people who have been following the Rosetta space probe and Philae lander as it approached and studied comet 67P/Churyumovâ€“Gerasimenko (67P).

As told in their own words, poems, images, linked videos and internet links, the book shows just how much the little space craft has affected the lives of many people (including young children) who have followed the mission through to its amazing conclusion.

You won't find many details about the actual mission itself in the book, but you will get an idea of just how effective ESA's media outreach and attempts to make people relate to the mission were as recorded in the words of the people themselves.
