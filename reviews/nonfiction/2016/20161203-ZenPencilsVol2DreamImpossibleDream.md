*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

Yet another good book of inspirational quotes with good artwork by Gavin Aung Than.

One of my favourites has to be the one he created around an Isaac Asimov quote about the joys of constant learning. Another nice one at the end is about fear and how can eat us up if we don't overcome it.
