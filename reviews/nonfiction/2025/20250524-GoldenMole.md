*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

A book featuring a range of interesting animals, one in each chapter. The author then gives various views on the animal from mythology, human history and natural history before closing with what the world would lose if the animal became extinct.

Many of the animals featured are now threatened with extinction, usually from hunting or from loss of habitat, and the author hopes that by telling their stories, we can all learn to appreciate them for what they are.
