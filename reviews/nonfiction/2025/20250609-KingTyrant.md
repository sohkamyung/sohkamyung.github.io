*Rating: 5/5 Stars.*

A fascinating, fact based look at the dinosaur that everybody has heard about: *Tyrannosaurus rex* (*T. rex*). There has been a lot of hype, mainly due to films, and outdated information about *T. rex* in the popular media, and this book helps the reader to understand just what we know about this prehistoric tyrant. In the process, we get to know the actual *T. rex* as revealed by fossils. Alongside the in-depth text about *T. rex*, we also get marvellous paleoartwork from the author, giving us imaginative glimpses of what it might be like to live in a world where *T. rex* roam.

What follows is a chapter by chapter look at the book.

Chapter 1 looks at the history of *T. rex*., starting with the discovery of large fossil bones, eventually described as *T. rex*. Early museum displays and illustrations in media show *T. rex* as a large, lumbering reptile. Then came the 'dinosaur renaissance', that argued that dinosaurs were active animals and some, especially *T. rex*, were mighty predators. This fed the imagination of the general audience and the media, resulting in modern depictions like those seen in the "Jurassic Park / Jurassic World" films. But those media depictions now threaten to 'fossilize' the image of *T. rex* and dinosaurs in general, while scientific research has continued to updated what we know about them (with features like feathers).

Chapter 2 looks at the family tree of Tyrannosaurs and also other families of dinosaurs and reptiles and how they compare with Tyrannosaurs. In the Triassic, giant relatives of the crocodile were the *T. rex* of the period. Later on, there were the Spinosaurids and Carcharodontosaurids that may rival the Tyrannosaurs in size and weight. The author looks at the differences and similarities between these families in their features and possible predatory behaviours. A look at various dinosaurs that probably belong to the Tyrannosaurid family is also given. The author does not hide the difficulties in deciding whether there is one or many Tyrannosaurid species, based on the current fossil record.

Chapter 3 look at the anatomy of *T. rex*, starting with the layout of body based on the fossil bones. The posture, the shape of the head, arms and legs is covered. Many technical terms are featured, but presented in a way that makes it understandable, with a bit of effort by this reader. Instead of being solid, dinosaurs bones are shown to be hollow, with air sacs to make bones lighter while still being strong. A look at the possible skin coverings on various parts of the body is then given, followed by the possibility of *T. rex* having lips and other kinds of soft tissue. Some speculation on the size of the eyes and how well *T. rex* can see is presented. Next, the possibility of *T. rex* having feathers or hair like covering is covered, as well as possible patterns and the colour of the skin.

Chapter 4 looks at the physiology of *T. rex*. Large animals retain heat, so a look at how *T. rex* could stay cool is given. There is also discussion on how much does it eat. The growth stages of *T. rex* is given: its young possibly having a gracile form, followed by a growth spurt during the teen years before turning into the huge adults. Based on the fossils we have, the possible sizes and mass of full grown adults is discussed, including the brain size and possible intelligence of *T. rex*, and how sensitive could its eyesight, sense of smell, touch, hearing could be. *T. rex* vocalisations is also covered (think low, loud rumbers, rather than roars), then investigations on *T. rex* locomotion (juveniles can run, while adults probably walked) and their possible swimming ability. Of course, no discussion would be complete without a look at the bite force of a *T. rex* and the possible use and movement of the arms (which are actually the length of human arms, but look puny on such a large creature).

Chapter 5 looks at where and when did *T. rex* lived. A look at other animals (both dinosaurs and non-dinosaurs) that lived at the time is also given. Based on the fossil record, *T. rex* was found in many areas in Western North America during the last 6 million years of the Cretaceous period. They are found in various environments, ranging from seasonal lowlands and coastal floodplains to volcanic highlands. Interestingly, fossils of other big predatory dinosaur fossils are not found in this period: only those of *T. rex*. The author presents this as *T. rex* fitting most of the predatory niches in the environment during its different life stages. The only other big predator found at this time might be the giant pterosaurs. The presence of horned and armoured dinosaurs in this time might indicate that some dinosaurs used them as defence against *T. rex*, but the more likely explanation (based on the fossil evidence and modern day animals) is that the horns and armour are used for competition for mates, rather than for defence.

Chapter 6 looks at what can be said about how *T. rex* lived based on the fossil evidence. Locomotion studies show that *T. rex* could migrate to follow the seasons. But they could also have stayed in one place, feeding on migrating animals, based on studied of their teeth. There is little fossil evidence they form social groups or hunt as a group. Some fossils of *T. rex* grouped together have been found, but these are most probably accidental groupings or opportunistic groups that formed to hunt. Wounds on *T. rex* faces indicate they bite each other, possibly during mating or ritualistic combat. The *T. rex* also actively hunts for prey, and is not a pure scavenger based on its food requirement. We also know how they feed based on *T. rex* bite marks on fossil bones. They are bite based predators that rip food from bone based on the scrape and puncture marks and location of bites on fossils. Of course, people are interested in the possible copulation behaviour of *T. rex*, with a possible position shown. The *T. rex* probably laid hard shelled eggs that are then buried or covered. Their parental behaviour is unknown; babies may lead independent lives from birth. From fossil bones, we know about the kind of injuries, bone pathologies and infections that *T. rex* suffer from. Lastly, a look at the possible mortality rates are given.

Chapter 7 look at the extinction of *T. rex* and the non-avian dinosaurs, mainly due to an asteroid that smashed into the earth. An early idea on how they became extinct was through "racial senility" (basically, dinosaurs evolved to become too senile). One idea, based on the lack of fossils found just before the asteroid hit, was that dinosaurs were headed for extinction already. But this, the author says, is due to in a change in the environment that limited the preservation of fossils, since it affects all kinds of fossils, not just of dinosaurs. In closing, the author describes the aftermath of the asteroid hit, and the effect it had on *T. rex* and life in general.
