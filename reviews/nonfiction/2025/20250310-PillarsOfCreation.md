*Rating: 4/5 Stars.*

A short but nice book on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), covering its history from conception to launch and commissioning, followed by chapters that look at how the JWST has changed the way we look at the solar system, the stars, the galaxies in the universe and how the universe began.

Starting as a planned next generation telescope after the Hubble Space Telescope, the first chapters cover the various ideas that were discussed over what astronomers want the new telescope to do. Politics and budget considerations would cause changes in the design and management of the telescope. Finally, after numerous delays and near cancellation, the JWST was launched, deployed successfully and began to return data that was better than expected.

The next chapter looks at JWST's contributions to planetary science. At one point, the JWST was not planned to do much observation in the solar system as it lacked a tracker to lock on to moving objects in the solar system. This was overcome by using an alternative method that proved to work better than expected: when the DART probe collided with Dimorphos (a moon orbiting the asteroid Didymos), JWST was able to track it and provided valuable data on the result of the collision. JWST was also able to provide spectroscopic data on the planets and their moons, helping to determine what elements and chemistry was happening on them.

Next, a look at what JWST can say about the nearby stars is covered. The JWST is able to detect exoplanets orbiting the stars by various methods, and even do spectroscopic analysis of the exoplanets' atmosphere. While tantalising signs of potential biochemistry have been detected, none have yet to meet the high standard (5 sigma) that mark a discovery.

Going further, the next chapter looks at the galaxies that dot the universe as seen by the JWST. Details on the evolution of stars and galaxies have helped cosmologist get a better idea of how galaxies have evolved throughout the universe.

Finally, the JWST looks past the galaxies and back in time to the period when the universe was still young. Where there have been headlines about "JWST breaking the cosmos", what JWST has actually done is provide even more data that are helping cosmologist refine their models of the cosmos, helping to give us a better picture of how the universe works.
