*Rating: 5/5 Stars.*

A marvellous compendium of the wonderful lifeforms that can be found around the world. You can choose to read the book from cover or cover, dip into it randomly or by section, or search through the index for specific details. Either way, you'll discover fascinating facts and stories that will entertain you.

The book is divided into several sections, each covering a specific environment: forest, grasslands, mountains, deserts, water, cities and island. Each section contains descriptions and stories about many organisms, each one taking up about a page. Areas with interesting environments are also presented. In Atlas Obscura style, each description ends with brief information on how to see the organism or visit the area, if possible. The book also features many wonderful images, and occasional drawings, of the organisms and areas visited.

Definitely a wonderful, and concise, guide to some of the natural wonders that can be found in the world.
