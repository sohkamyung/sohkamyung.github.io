*Rating: 4/5 Stars.*

A fascinating book that looks that large variety of moths that can be found in the world. After beetles, the family Lepidoptera ('scaled insects') is one of the largest family of insects and this book covers all the major groups of moths except one: the butterflies, which have their own book.

The book starts with a general overview of the moths, showing their anatomy, general behaviour and biology. As caterpillars, moths are 'eating machines' while as adults, moths are 'reproductive machines', a specialisation that has enabled the group to spread out and occupy many ecological niches from the tropics to the polar regions. Moths are major pollinators (and pests of crops) and can be feeding on plants from the ground upwards, and even on aquatic plants. Some caterpillars are also predators, feeding on aphids. Moths are also a source of food for other animals (including humans), leading some to develop intimidating spines and venoms for defence.

The book then proceeds to list down the moths, arranged into families and subfamilies, listing down their major features, behaviours, ecology and so on of each family. Numerous superb photos of the eggs, caterpillars and adults are included, showing some moths with splendid patterns and colouration to rival that of the better known butterflies.

This book is not the final word on moths. Many moth species, including their life histories, are still not known to science and future genetic studies may rearrange the taxonomic family of moths. But until the next edition of the book is released, this one sits as a good, general guide to the moths of the world. A list of references is also given for those who wish to know more about moths from a specific region of interest.
