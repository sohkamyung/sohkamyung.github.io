*Rating: 5/5 Stars.*

The Bodleian Libraries put up a Tolkien exhibition in 2018 and this book was released as a companion book to the exhibition. For those who went (and those, like me, who didn't or couldn't), the book is the best way of looking at what the exhibition featured, namely the works of J.R.R. Tolkien.

The book starts with a series of introductions covering Tolkien's life, his relationship with the famous group, the Inklings (which includes C.S. Lewis), his concept of the Faerie (as opposed to Fairies), his invention of the Elvish languages, his fascinating with the mythology of the Northern world and, finally, his artistic side.

The rest of the book looks at the various items featured in the exhibition along with an explanation. Chapter One looks at various letters Tolkien received from his readers. Chapter Two features photos, letters and items from his childhood. Chapter Three looks at his student days and includes photos of his activities and friends including his beloved Edith Bratt. Chapter Four features various watercolours and drawings he did of the land of Faerie and other places.

Chapter Five features notes and sketches he did while working on his unfinished book, "The Silmarillion" (on the world of the Elves). Chapter Six looks at items in his study, featuring his working desk, sketches and several of his fascinating 'Father Christmas' letters.

Chapter Eight looks at the sketches, drawings, maps and notes he wrote while working on "The Hobbit". Chapter Nine covers "The Lord of the Rings" and Chapter Ten covers the various maps he and his son, Christopher, worked on while working out the geography of Middle Earth.

For those who enjoyed the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, the exhibition would be a must-see event. For those who couldn't see it (and even for those who did), this book is a good companion to the exhibition. The only downside to the book is that the items featured are not the original ones but photo reproductions. Due to their age, some of the writings and sketches have become faint and, while the book does it best, some of it is unreadable without closer examination of the actual item. Otherwise, an enjoyable book to read and see how life might have been for Tolkien while he was working on his famous Legendarium.
