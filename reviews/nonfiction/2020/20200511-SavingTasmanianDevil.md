*Rating: 4/5 Stars*

An interesting book on the Tasmanian Devil, the Devil facial tumour disease (DFTD) and the efforts by scientists to save the Devils.

The book starts with an introduction to the Devils themselves, followed by the discovery of DFTD and what makes it so different compared to other forms of cancer. The book then covers the various scientists in various locations doing different kinds of research in the race to save the Devils from the disease.

Some of the scientists are studying the Devil's biology and environment to learn how they live and breed. Others are looking at DFTD directly to learn what it is, how it spreads and what can be done to make the Devils immune to the disease. Others are working on conservation, making sure the Devil have places to live on Tasman island with the support of the local community.

For now, it appears that some Devils can survive DFTD and they are adapting to it. The future of the Devil isn't yet certain but you will get some optimistic answers about the future of the Tasmanian Devil from this short, yet comprehensive book on the Devils.
