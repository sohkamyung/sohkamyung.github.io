# Non-Fiction Book Reviews

[Main Index](../../README.md) / [Reviews Index](../README.md)

This is the main page of my non-fiction book reviews, organised by the start/end date the book is read in reverse chronological order.

For now all books reviewed can be found on this page until some time in the future, if it needs to be broken up due to length.
