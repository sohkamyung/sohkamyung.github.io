An amazing book with fabulous images of Saturn, its moons and its surroundings as taken by now departed Cassini space probe.

What makes this book outstanding are not just its images, but the descriptions that come with it. You'll discover details on what you are seeing and how Cassini took the image. This is important, as Cassini sends back the images as a stream of data. The scientists who receive the data have a responsibility to explain how the data should be interpreted as an image, and to explain to the viewers just what they are seeing.

This is much better than just seeing an image by itself with no explanation; which can lead to false interpretations as to what is being seen.

This book is a good resource to use if you've seen the images of the Saturn system as imaged by Cassini and want to learn more about just what you're seeing. The book also serves as a wonderful legacy for Cassini which, after it's many years in space, has been retired by being sent into Saturn, to protect the environment of the many moons of Saturn from contamination from Earth via Cassini.
