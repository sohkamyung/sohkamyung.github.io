*Rating: 4/5 Stars.*

An interesting general book about dinosaurs. It includes the latest research on dinosaurs to give a comprehensive and up-to-date view of them.

The book starts with a general overview of the dinosaur family, starting from their beginnings. It then covers the dinosaur family tree, showing where the various known dinosaurs sit in it.

The book then covers the anatomy of dinosaurs, showing how the various bones fit together. Depending on your current knowledge of dinosaur anatomy, you may learn some things. For me, it was that the posture of sauropods as usually depicted in various museums may not be anatomically correct. And, of course, the hands of the tyrannosaur and various theropods.

The book then goes into what the fossils, and other information taken from them, can tell us about how dinosaurs may have lived, their possible behaviours and about the surrounding environment at the time.

The book then looks at the one surviving branch of the dinosaurs: the birds. It also looks at the event that caused the extinction of the rest of the dinosaurs and how the world looked in its aftermath.

Depending on how much you already know about dinosaurs, you may or may not learn something new from this book. But it will help to let you know what is our current knowledge about dinosaurs and what remains to be discovered.
