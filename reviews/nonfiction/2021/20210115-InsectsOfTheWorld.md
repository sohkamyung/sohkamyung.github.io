*Rating: 5/5 Stars.*

This is an educational and illustrated introduction to the insects of the world. After a brief and general introduction to insects, the book then goes through the various orders of insects. It starts with the earliest insects, the Bristletails and Silverfish, and then proceeds through the rest of the insects, more or less in the order they start to appear on the tree of life on Earth: mayflies, dragonflies and damselflies, cockroaches and termites, mantids, earwigs, crickets and grasshoppers, stick and leaf insects, lice, true bugs, hoppers and cicadas, beetles, fleas, flies, moths and butterflies and finally, the wasps, ants and bees. Other orders of insects are also covered in the book that are not mentioned here.

The book is illustrated with plenty of photos of insects taken in the field, letting the reader see how the insect might appear in real life. Some insects are, of course, very good at camouflage and this is shown in some photos where the reader is challenged to find the insect in the photo. Sadly, this reader was not able to successfully find all the insects in such images, which is a disappointment.

Other than that, the book is a good way to learn about the enormous world of different kinds of insects that can be found all over the world.
