*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

An interesting illustrated book about dinosaurs that gives an overview of the history of discoveries about dinosaurs. From early times when the fossils of dinosaurs were first dug up and though to be that of biblical monsters, to today, when some dinosaurs are now thought to have feathers, this book covers it all.

Due to the large amount of history to be covered, much of the information is condensed into a few panels or a few pages, which may occasionally leave the reader eager for more information. For that you'll probably have to refer to other books on dinosaurs, but if you are looking for an overall view on what we thought about dinosaurs through the ages, this book is a good start.
