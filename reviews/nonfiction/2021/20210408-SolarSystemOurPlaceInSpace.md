*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

An interesting comic about the Solar System, highlighting some of the interesting features of some of the planets and moons. In the comic, Sara is sick and is staying at home and finding it boring. Along comes Jill to cheer her up by creating a story about a spacecraft, crewed by their pets as astronauts, exploring the solar system from the Sun outwards.

The ship is powered by Sara's excitement level, so the crew sets out ofto point out interesting features of the Sun, Mercury, and so on, slowly building up fuel and increasing Sara's excitement about the Solar System.

Those who already know the information about the Solar System may not find much new information here, but the way it is presented, as byte sized pieces of information, may help to introduce those new to astronomy with some wonders to be found in the solar system.
