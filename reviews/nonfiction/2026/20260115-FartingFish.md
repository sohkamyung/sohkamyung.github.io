A funny and thought-provoking book showcasing some of the winners of the Ig Nobel prize. The prize honours achievements that make you laugh and then, make you think. Many of the entries in this book should make you laugh, and then make you think about what was achieved.

The book is divided into sections, featuring entries involving animals, human biology, human behaviour and human mental processes. Each entry shows the question, what research was done to answer the question, and the results.

The entries are short, making the book an easy and entertaining read, and giving you lots of trivia which you can use to either gross out or fascinate your guests at parties.
