*Rating: 4/5 Stars.*

A fascinating book that looks that large variety of butterflies that can be found in the world. The family Lepidoptera ('scaled insects') is one of the largest family of insects and this book covers one part of the family: the butterflies. Moths, which actually make up a major part of the family Lepidoptera, are covered in a companion book.

The book starts with a general overview of the butterflies, showing their anatomy, general behaviour and biology. Butterfly caterpillars are 'eating machines' while the adults are 'reproductive machines', a specialisation that has enabled the group to spread out and occupy many ecological niches from the tropics to the polar regions. Some caterpillars are also predators, feeding on aphids. Because butterflies are familiar, 'flashy', and often seen (they are the 'daytime moths'), they have become important as a way to inform the public about wildlife insect conservation.

The book then proceeds to list down the moths, arranged into families and subfamilies, listing down their major features, behaviours, ecology and so on, of each family. Numerous superb photos of the adults are included, showing some butterflies with splendid patterns and colouration.

This book is not the final word on butterflies. Many species, including their life histories, are still not known to science and future genetic studies may rearrange the taxonomic their family. But until the next edition of the book is released, this one is a good, general guide to the butterflies of the world. A list of references is also given for those who wish to know more about butterflies from a specific region of interest.
