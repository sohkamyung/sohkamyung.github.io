*Rating: 5/5 Stars*

A fabulous coffee-table sized book, featuring hundreds of images taken during the Apollo missions, along with some from the earlier Mercury and Gemini missions. As described at the end of the book, the images were digitally scanned from the original master images from the missions that have been kept in cold storage. The scanned images were then altered to adjust the contrast and colour and to remove dust, damage and other artefacts. Panoramic images were stitched together, while some images were stacked to improve the image quality and recover some image details.

The result are large, fantastic images of space, the Earth and the Moon that are close to what the astronauts would have actually seen. You may have probably seen similar images to those in the book from other publications or website, but few, if any, look as excellent or as true to life as those featured in this book.

Captions are provided with each image, giving a reference number and the context for the images: what the image is showing, how the image was taken and, if known, who took the image and when.

At the time of this review, there are plans to return people to the moon. Until then, these images are probably the best images available that show what it was like to travel through space and to walk and explore on the moon.
