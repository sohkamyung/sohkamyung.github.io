*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

An interesting book that looks at the history and context of the various parts of a modern book and how they came to be. Starting with what covers a book (the dust jacket), the book then looks at what goes in the front of a book (the title, copyright info, publishers info, introduction, table of content, list of characters), what is included with the content (chapter headings, illustrations, footnotes) and what goes in the back (erratas, indexes).

Some parts can be rather dry reading, but some fascinating information on how some parts of a book appeared in the past and then evolved into its current form are fascinating. The book also gives a brief look at how ebooks are affecting the presentation of these parts of the book.
