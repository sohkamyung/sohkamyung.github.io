*Rating: 4/5 Stars*

A fascinating book of maths based games for two or more players. Separated into various categories, there are more than enough here to keep more maths minded people happy. Most of the games can be played using coloured pens or pencils and paper with dice (on-line ones will do). The book might be a hit for families or groups who are interested in mathematical fun (and some disguised mathematical lessons).

Each game starts with an introduction to the game and its rules, then some notes on the games, a brief history of the games, why they are mathematically interesting, and closes with variations of the games that can be played.

You don't have to read the book from cover to cover, although that is the way to read it to discover all the games covered in the book. If you have an interest in a certain type of game, you can skip directly to it. A case could also be made to turn the book itself into a game by letting each person in your group choose a game to play (by choice or randomly).

Even if you don't play the games, the background material is sufficiently interesting for those into mathematics and discovering (or learning) some of the possibly strategies (if any) than be used to play the games.
