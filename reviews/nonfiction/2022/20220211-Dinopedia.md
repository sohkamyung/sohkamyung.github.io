*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

An interesting A-Z book filled with facts on various dinosaurs (how they may have looked and lived), some places where dinosaurs fossils have been found, and some people who have influenced how the world sees dinosaurs. It also features dinosaur illustrations by the author.

The book is probably best read by those who already know something about dinosaurs and some terminology used to describe dinosaurs (their names, groups, clades, etc.), and are looking for a quick dive into specific topics on dinosaurs.
