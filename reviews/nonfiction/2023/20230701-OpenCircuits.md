*Rating: 5/5 Stars.*

A lovely book about electrical and electronic components that will delight those who have ever wondered what the insides of them look like. Lots of photographs showing the details of the components can be found in the book, along with descriptions of what they are made out of.

The book covers passive components (resistors, capacitors, inductors), semiconductors (individual transistors, diodes, chip packages), electromechanical parts (switches), cables and connectors (including jacks), retro technology (Nixie tubes) and composite devices (MicroSD cards, credit chip cards).

If you have ever wondered how an electrical or electronic part looks like or works, you may find yourself mesmerized by the details in the book. One thing I picked up: the correct name for the nine-pin serial connector is DE-9, not DB-9.
