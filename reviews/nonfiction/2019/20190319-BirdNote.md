*Rating: 4/5 Stars*

An interesting book about one hundred birds, mainly North American ones. Each bird is featured with a short note on its features and some interesting facts about the bird: its biology and/or its behaviour. Most of the birds also feature an illustration.

The book is not organized to be a nature guide book, but more towards those who know a bit about the various birds featured and would like to know a few more interesting facts about the birds themselves.
