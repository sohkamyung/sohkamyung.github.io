*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

An interesting book that looks at the Earth through images as seen by various earth monitoring satellites.

Separated into several sections, the book features images showing the different environments found on the earth: the atmosphere, water, land and ice and snow. Each image comes with an explanation of how the image was taken, and what we are seeing in the images. This allows the reader to understand what the image shows instead of just considering the image from an artistic angle.

A nice overview of what the different regions of the world look like when seen from outer space.
