*Rating: 4/5 Stars*

A book filled with lots of lovely food featured from all over the world. Some history on how the food is created, either by local people or by people have historically migrated to the area from the past, is given, along with some recommended places to try the food. The way some of the food is prepared may be considered disgusting to an outsider, so trying it may be challenging.

There are also interesting stories of people trying to revive recipes of food as prepared by their ancestors, while others are of migrants adapting the recipes they have known for generations in their new country. In any case, the food presented in the book may tempt the reader to give them a try, rather than sticking to the usual food eaten by tourists.
