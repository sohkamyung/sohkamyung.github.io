*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

A story that feels like a fragment of a longer tale, it tells the story of a soldier tasked with protecting the secret location of a digital entity from intrusions. For total security, the digital entity only employs people who do not have embedded digital connections with the outside world (security via physicality), makes copies of itself in safe locations (security via redundancy) and hides in obscure locations (security via obscurity).

But even then the soldier will learn that despite all the security, something or someone has penetrated its security, and she now has to think and move fast to save her own life and possibly that of the entity. And the intrusion may be connected with events happening in the outside world.
