In a future where social media is a way of life, getting good referrals via social media is important. So, when strange things start to happen at a shop of a health care brand that gets smeared horrifically both physically and on social media, it's up to the workers at the shop to work out that their owner had hired the fae people to promote the health brand, but has not been keeping up her end of the bargain. Now they have to figure out a way to keep their jobs while satisfying the fae who are targeting their particular shop.
