Set in Iceland, the story leads a male witch on a trail to find his brother to inform him that he has been pardoned for a crime which got him exiled. But he finds the trail leads to a farm which tells him he has to deal with a volcano and obtain an elixir from it before he can talk to his brother.

An interesting story that weaves together magic, compassion for a lame, potentially sacrificial horse and the telling of riddles.
