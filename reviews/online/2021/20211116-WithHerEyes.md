*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

An interesting story about an overworked person taking a break. But he does it by bringing along a pair of glasses connected to what he thinks is a worker in space who is also taking a break by virtually visiting the Earth through his glasses.

At first, he is amused by the awe felt by the worker for simple things like a field of flowers. But amusement turns into irritation when she begins to demand him to let her watch a setting sun or a rising moon. Finally, he has had enough and returns the glasses.

But it is only later when he re-examines the clues in their conversations does he begin to suspect that the person is not in space, but may have another reason for being grateful for being able to see the wonders that the surface of the Earth can provide.
