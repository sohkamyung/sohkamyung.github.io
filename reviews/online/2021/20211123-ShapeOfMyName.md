*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

A time-travel story told linearly from the point of view of the first-person narrator, who grows up hating the name (not said in the story) given to her by her mother. Then she learns of the time-travel machine maintained by her family for generations (and its limitations) and goes on a journey to discover herself and the reason her mother eventually leaves her.

As in most time-travel stories, it all comes back full circle once the narrator realizes what she wants and is willing to reconcile with her mother.
