*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

An interesting story about a Vampire Judge who upholds the laws that apply to vampires (human laws don't apply, as vampires don't see themselves as human: humans are considered 'cattle' as far as vampires are concerned) who, along with his human companion and observer, goes to resolve a dispute between two vampire families about a vampire killing.

The climax would see more vampire blood spilled and a judgement by Judge Dee who recognizes that what has transpired may lie outside the law as he sees it.
