*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

The title probably gives the game away, but this is a story about the horrors of a land well known to those who enjoy the works of H.P. Lovecraft. But the actual story itself is more of a prelude to the actual expedition.

It starts when a researcher decides to take a DNA test and discovers that a significant part of her own DNA is 'unknown'. Some digging reveals that another person may also have the same unknown DNA but attempts to personally meet the person fail, but in a rather inhuman way.

Clues lead them to a certain popular island off the Atlantic coast and it is here that the adventure to the land in the title begins. As the story ends, the researcher learns to accept the truth behind her unknown DNA: and to prepare for the real adventure in the land of horrors.
