*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

Set in a place that appears to be a sealed, biologically contained world, this is a story about two people in love who don't fit in the society of artistic giving and taking, who push at the boundaries which, biologically speaking, push back.

One person is interested in ancient artistic technologies and, through trial and error, produces a new form of artistic expression: paper. The other uses the paper to produce artwork that questions the existence of their enclosed world and asks what is outside it.

Both are dangerous questions to ask in this world and when the world pushes back at them, they know they have no choice but to push at the boundaries and see what lies beyond them.
