*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

A story of a boy who, while generally obedient, disobeys his mother's orders in small ways, like taking shortcuts to get back home. On one of these shortcuts, he encounters colourful African Masquerades who say they are his and follow him home.

Then the trouble starts, for his mother begins to make small requests, taking pieces from his Masquerades to put into her own designs to be sold. And one day, the boy decides to disobey his mother in a big way.
