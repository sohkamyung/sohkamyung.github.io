*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

An unusual fantasy story involving a time-travelling Lady Annie who is cross with her trickster lover Crow, and goes back in time to her land in 16th Century England. There, she finds a young lad (Shakespeare) in her home which is not meant to have any males. More to the point, she discovers a plot to change the future of humanity to which she is not invited to; so she invites herself.

There, she royally messes up the plans of some Lords for future world domination, causing a conflict that is only resolved after an invasion of her home and her revenge via seduction. And all is apparently forgiven between her and Crow.

Not being aware of the past history of stories (if any) involving Annie and Crow, it is hard to say if this is part of a series or a fragment of a longer tale. But still a fun read.
