Two people are put together on an unusual organic spaceship to make a journey to a distant world to make a claim on it by a company. One is a pilot of the ship, the other has been tasked to make the claim, but in a way that is not known to him. On the journey itself, they get to know each other better. But the past of one of them is 'locked up' in a box that, only towards the end, is unlocked. Those memories would be linked to what they would find at the other end and reveal just what he is meant to do to stake the claim.
