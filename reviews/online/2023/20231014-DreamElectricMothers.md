In an African country facing conflict, the government decides to consult its ancestors, electronically stored in a facility. But one minister would take advantage of the mental connection to contract its ancestors to try to arrange a meeting with her dead mother. The meeting would, perhaps, lead to another answer on how to avoid conflict, if possible.
