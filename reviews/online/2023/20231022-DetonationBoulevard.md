During a race that requires the racers to circumnavigate Io, the satellite of Jupiter, one racer does the unthinkable and tries to help another racer. That would cause the racer to reevaluate just what is important to her as a human and the nature of what the race does to them: for the racers are all enhanced, or 'repaired', after racing accidents. At what point do the enhancements make a racer less than human?
