Another story in the author's Vampire Judge Dee's (and helper, Jonathan) series of stories, this one has the Judge travelling to an English castle, where its vampire master is certain somebody is trying to kill him. Despite the precautions, death does happen in a locked coffin and, given the clues given in the story, the reader might have a chance to deduce what happened before the Judge, or Jonathan, do.
