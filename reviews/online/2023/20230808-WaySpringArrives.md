*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

An interesting mix of Eastern mythology and modern day geology and astronomy. A boy goes on a journey with a girl he claims he is going to marry. But the girl is more than just a girl, as the journey reveals, for she is on a task; to bring spring to the world by ferrying a huge globe of hot water north to warm up the world and adjust the axis of the world to bring more light to the north. The journey will also reveal just how much the boy loves the girl and what he is willing to do to prove his love to her.
