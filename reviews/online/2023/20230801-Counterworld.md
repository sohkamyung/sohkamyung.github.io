The world of a grieving mother is turned upside-down one day when she wakes up to find the world has erased the physical existence and memory of her lost child. The only 'evidence' that he once existed remains in the reflection of a mirror which only she can see and which she clings to, even when the rest of the world thinks she is mentally unstable.
