Quandary Aminu was handling an illicit trade when it goes bad, and the boss blames her for it. The result is a genetically engineered killer, known as the Butterfly Man, being grown and send to kill her. As the story progresses, and she runs to avoid the killer, a conversation with somebody she knows well leads to a conclusion about whom was behind the deal going bad. Now she wants to go after him.
