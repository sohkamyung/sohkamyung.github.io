*Rating: 4/5 Stars.*

An interesting story of a future where much is going wrong with the world. But instead of tackling it head on, the teenagers of this world seem to prefer to relive the past, wearing somewhat period-accurate clothes and acting as if the past was just happening.

One father, working to catalogue what is left of the world, struggles to understand his daughter's interest and behaviour in the past, and tries to get her to accept the present. But when their arguments reach breaking point, the father makes a starling discovery about his daughter that makes him re-examine his relationship with her and, perhaps accept that in reliving the past, the daughter is trying to make a better future.
