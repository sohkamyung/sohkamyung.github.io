*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

In a future where civilization seems to have fallen in Singapore (and possibly surrounding areas), the former Supreme Court building lies alone and abandoned to its fate. But one day, children enter to play and to revive memories of past grievances, giving presence to local ghosts, or perhaps the ghost of the building itself.
