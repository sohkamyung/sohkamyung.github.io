An interesting story about a rural school bus driver who discovers her bus is being pursued by a dragon. She has no choice but to ask her rebellious daughter for help in keeping the students on the bus from being eaten by the dragon. Also told in the story is how her daughter grew up like she did (large and sullen) and her relationship with her daughter as driver tries to protect her from the bad decisions she made when young.
