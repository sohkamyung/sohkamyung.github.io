*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

A person who illustrates and produces copies of parchment books is forced to create an illuminated and translated version of a text on ancient paper. But an examination of the text shows it to contain a form of religious Truth that could shake the foundations of the person's country. It would require all her skills, and the pulling of strings of acquaintances, to escape from the situation.
