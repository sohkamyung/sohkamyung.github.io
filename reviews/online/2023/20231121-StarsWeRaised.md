*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

A story about growing up while feeling isolated. In a small village, the children catch floating stars as pets, which are eventually harvested. But one child, picked upon by the others, keeps his star despite being bullied about it by the others, until it is lost.

The children all grow up, and one day, the former child and his best friend go on a trip to harvest stars in the mountains. What they see and find there among the stars would be a wonder; and also a sadness over lost childhood desires.
