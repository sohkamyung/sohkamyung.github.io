*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

An interesting contemporary story with a light 'dusting' of fantasy of an aspiring artist. One day, she visits the location of her favourite poet and sees a dramatic vision. Her attempts at painting the vision afterwards are greeted with confusion and meme generation that give her some notoriety and leads to changes in her life. But in the end, she adjusts and finds a way to be at peace with the painting as the world sees it.
