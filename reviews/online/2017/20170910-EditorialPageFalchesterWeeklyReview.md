*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

A short fun piece, set after Brennan's "Voyage of the Basilisk" where Isabella doubts that a discovery by another person of an unusual dragon specimen is what the person says it is. This is played out on the correspondents page of the newspaper and ends with what happens when she finally gets to see it.
