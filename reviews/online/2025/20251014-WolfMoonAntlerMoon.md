*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

A horror story that starts in a small town with the casual murder of five girls. As the story reveals, this is no ordinary small town, but one where that is a balance between predators (wolves) and prey (deer), with the townspeople taking on one of the roles by donning a 'skin'. But now, that balance is being threatened by a group of hunters.

Restoring the balance may require one girl who had a mystical grandmother, who had a role in keeping the balance in the past, subduing predators when required. And now, it may be up to the girl to do the same with the hunters, but doing so would require a sacrifice that only a wolf can perform.

The story skips back and forth in time around the time of the murder, slowly revealing the relationships between the girl, her grandmother and town people, and the role her grandmother did and which she now has to perform.
