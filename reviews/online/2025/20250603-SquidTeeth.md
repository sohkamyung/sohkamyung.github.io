Set in a world where people spin clay plates using their mouths, and produce patterns on the plate using ink pouches in their mouths, one artist has the opportunity to become a famous plate spinner. But to do it, he has to join a competition and become one of the winners. During the competition, he sees the results it has on those who did not make it, and starts to have second thoughts.
