*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

A humourous and suitably weird story about an alien invasion and the attempt to move a rather large couch across town that the aliens are apparently interested in. It would be pretty obvious that one character and her magic levitating vacuum cleaner are not who they seem to be. But it would require a trip through space to fully reveal what the couch is capable of, in a homage to the Culture stories of Iain M. Banks.

*Story read from 2025/07/11 to 2025/07/11.*
