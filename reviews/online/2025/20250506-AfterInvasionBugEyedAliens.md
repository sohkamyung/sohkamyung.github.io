An interesting story consisting of the relationship between two nurses, one human, one Mantodean  (aliens that look like giant mantises and behave like them) living with each other on Earth after a truce in a war between humans and Mantodeans. Through a series of vignettes in the story, we learn more about how humans and Mantodeans live on Earth after the war: initially wary, then acceptance and then the formation of new relationships and new ways to live together.
