*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

A story set in a future where humanity has spread far and wide in the universe via work done a subgroup of humans (disparagingly called Geckos) to terraform the worlds. Due to their work, this subgroup has become toxic to the rest of humanity, being isolated by air filters and barriers.

As the story starts, a group of these people have revolted against their work conditions and hijacked a ship and a pilot to go to the planet Pandora. Things get complicated when the pilot develops feelings for one of the Geckos. But together, they have to crack the puzzle that is Pandora, for they need to access what Pandora has access to.

After solving the puzzle and getting access, they reach their target. And it is there that puzzles and mysteries about how the Geckos and the spread of humanity really happened start to be answered. And the answers they find are not expected, and will overturn their entire worldview and their own history: but it will show a way to reunite humanity again and remake their working conditions.
