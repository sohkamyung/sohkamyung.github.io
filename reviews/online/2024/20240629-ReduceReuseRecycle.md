*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

An android, who has been working at a factory for nearly ten years, is given one week of freedom to explore the surroundings. What it discovers are fascinating sights and even more fascinating people. But things starts to change when the android discovers one particular hidden book and meets up with a group of people who accept the android as one of them and shows him more wonders about the world, and about relating to other people.

When the android returns to the factory for re-evaluation, its changed state and a revelation about its past would bring matters to a head between the android and its owners: and, perhaps, lead to even more changes for the android in the future.
