Becoming a superhero has become regulated, and all applicants have to fill in Form 8774-D; or else. This story is about one bureaucrat whose job in the department is to deal with those applicants and make sure they fill it in as expected. Of course, there will be some superhero-wannabes that don't play by the rules, resulting in mayhem at the department. But with some help, perhaps she can make it through the day without too much trouble.
