A short story prequel to "Legends & Lattes" involving Viv the Orc and a few other characters, who are on the hunt for a robber who has stolen some plans. With some detective work, Viv discovers the robber's hideout but has a change of mind when she discovers why the robber was hiding there; for like the robber, Viv is also looking for a way out of their current way of life. The story ends, as expected, with Viv discovering what she would like to do next, leading to the beginning of the book, "Legends & Lattes".
