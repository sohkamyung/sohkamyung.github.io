*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

A story set at a time where civilization has partially collapsed, and a group of people living together are surviving the best they can. Then, one of their members vanish, only to make contact some time later, leading to members of the group to go out to try to find her.

Unfortunately, I feel I am missing the context and background of the characters in the story, giving me the feeling that I've wandered into the middle of the story, not the beginning. Apart from the inclusion of recipes in the story, I did not get much out of it.
