A story of a reporter who visits a community of people living in a landfill to discover their views on having enough to eat. But what they can now eat may make the reader uncomfortable, and it is the reporter's way of regaining respect, for she once worked at the company that imploded when the method used to allow the landfill people to eat was revealed.
