*Rating: 4/5 Stars.*

An interesting tale of a time in the future when a plague has caused much of civilization to collapse. One old man who lived through the time now works on transcribing only true things about the world. When he rests, he spends his time bringing a young girl (who does not speak) around town, where we get to see the after effects the plague has had on the world.

But the old man is getting weaker and suffering from more pain, and wonders how it would affect his relationship with the girl, for the plague has had an effect on him too, one that he has to hide from a world that fears, and kills people who are not normal.
