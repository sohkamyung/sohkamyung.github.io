*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

Another vampire Judge Dee story. This one has him and Jonathan in pursuit of another vampire: only this time, Jonathan isn't sure why, since the vampire is apparently a librarian who hasn't murdered anybody. This story fills in some history on Judge Dee, and it becomes apparent that this particular case is a personal one for the Judge, and starts when the Judge was still young (hard to believe, but yes) and still learning the law. The story has a subplot where Jonathan meets a girl and falls in love.
