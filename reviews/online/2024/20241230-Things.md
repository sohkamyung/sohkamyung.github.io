*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

An interesting re-telling of the film, "The Thing" by John Carpenter, from the view point of the Thing. To the Thing, the idea that people like us have a fixed form and are unable to change shape, merge or separate, is repelling, leading to an ending that is the same as the film's but with a conclusion that is appropriate for the Thing.
