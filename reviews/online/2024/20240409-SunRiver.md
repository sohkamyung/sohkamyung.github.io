*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

In an alternate Egypt, a princess with the ability to 'throw' her consciousness into birds to control them and see what they see, gets involved in a conspiracy by European powers to sabotage a company she has shares in. Working (perhaps romantically) with an American actress (who is more than just an actress), they spy on proceedings to uncover the plot. The princess' ability would involve her into doing quick acts with the birds to help save the day.
