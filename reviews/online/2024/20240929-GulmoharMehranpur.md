*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

The Nawab (ruler) of Mehranpur is offered a meal that can bring eternal youth, taking many days to prepare. During that time, the Namab worries about his tree, a Gulmohar, which is wilting and dying. Just before the meal is ready, he is summoned by the ruler of another kingdom, which the Nawab is a subject of, and told to uproot and present his tree to the ruler. As the Nawab ponders what to do, the meal is present: its effect would make the Nawab consider alternatives to the ruler's demand.
