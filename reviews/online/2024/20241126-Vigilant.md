*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

A story about a hacker who tries to help a student who suffers from anxiety at school, causing him to take his exams from home. Only, this is worse, as the anti-cheating software installed on his computer to scrutinize him as he takes the exam makes him even more anxious. The hacker tries to help him by circumventing the anti-cheating software, only to finally realize that he should really listen to what the student wants and that, sometimes, technology isn't the help that is needed.
