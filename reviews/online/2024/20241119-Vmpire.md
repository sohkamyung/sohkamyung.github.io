*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

A story of abuse of a person. It starts online when one online abuser starts calling this person a racist (among other things) for not supporting the rights of vampires to exist and be welcomed. This escalates into gaslighting when the abuser pushes into the person's life and turns out to be a real vampire. It only ends, in a twist, when others turn up and help the person realise that he already fits into a group and does not need to pretend to be someone else.

*Story read from 2024/11/19 to 2024/11/20.*
