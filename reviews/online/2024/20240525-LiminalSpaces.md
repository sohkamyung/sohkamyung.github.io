The story of a person who, while walking through an airport terminal, suddenly discovers herself wandering in another airport terminal. Her attempts to figure out how it happened becomes an obsession when it happens several more times. Finally, as she gives up on finding an explanation, it happens once again, but this time, perhaps she can just accept it as a fact without explanation.
