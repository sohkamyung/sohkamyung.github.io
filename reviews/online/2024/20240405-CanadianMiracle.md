A Canadian goes to the US (Mississippi) to help with recovery efforts. But she has to be very careful who she helps and how she helps, for the US state is in the grip of an election between progressives and extreme conservatives who will take any advantage of 'outsiders' coming to help as a pretext for baying that 'socialists' are coming to 'invade' and 'take away' their freedoms.

A moment of inattention is all that is needed for the bad news to spread, but perhaps the repercussions may not have the intended effect.
