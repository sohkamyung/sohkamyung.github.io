*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

An entertaining story set in the Victorian-era, about an ambitious man who wants to quickly rise in his station. To achieve that, he pays for and receives the egg of a Kraken. When it hatches, it proves to have a voracious appetite, which leads to disaster when it eventually escapes. Tied up in the story is a backstory about a non-European bandit who has a submersible who wants to throw off the yoke of imperialism, and the enslavement of mermen.
