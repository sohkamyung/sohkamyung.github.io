*Rating: 4/5 Stars*

An interesting story of a woman who takes care of bees. One day she reluctantly enrols in a programme to monitor the weather based on the behaviour of her bees. That would lead to a relationship with a researcher through messaging and, perhaps an opening up after her last relationship ended.
