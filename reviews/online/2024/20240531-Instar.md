*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

The story initially starts off as a woman looking for her child, which she believes was kidnapped by a man. It then becomes a confusing confrontation between the woman and man over the child. But it is only with the appearance of agents in biohazard suits that the true nature of the kidnapped child becomes evident to the reader, if not to the people involved.
