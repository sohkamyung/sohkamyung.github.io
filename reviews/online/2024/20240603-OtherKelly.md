*Rating: 2/5 Stars*

A rather rambling story about a group of presumed friends who don't really seem to like each other, and especially Kelly, who appears to be always late or doing things they rather not discover. One day, they discover another Kelly in their midst who doesn't talk or do much. And then, the story ends, without much of a resolution.
