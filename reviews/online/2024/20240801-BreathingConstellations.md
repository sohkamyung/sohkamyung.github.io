In this story, people can now communicate with Orcas. A sister and her brother are trying to talk with a pod of Orcas near their community to get permission to harvest from the waters controlled by the Orcas. Her request is rejected, and she fears her community may have to leave or starve. But then, one orca offers another chance to talk, if she is willing to get out of her comfort zone.
