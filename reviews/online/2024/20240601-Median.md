*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

A caregiver's car breaks down on the median in the middle of a highway. Strangely, other vehicles ignore her attempts to get help, and her attempts to contact emergency services and others fail. Then, she starts to get calls from strangers. Finally, she encounters another tragic scene on the highway and, perhaps, realizes her situation in this strange, unsettling story.
