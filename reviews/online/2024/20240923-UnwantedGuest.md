*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

Not having read her books before, I am not familiar with the characters of Palamedes Sextus and Ianthe Tridentarius in this story, nor with their background, which affected my understanding of the story.

Having said that, I find the form of the story, set as a play with several scenes and inter-scene conversations, interesting. The two characters are fighting over the soul of another person, which is supposed to be settled by the answering of questions. But by the end, the story has changed into a question of whether the soul is still there or not.
