In a future where the climate crises are common, one person works as part of teams to clear and rebuild after storms, hurricanes, wildfires, etc. have passed. But he has now grown weary and thinks of his retirement. But the constant crises should have shown him that nobody, not even a person used to rebuilding after a disaster, is safe from disasters.
