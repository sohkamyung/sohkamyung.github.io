In a future of rising sea levels and more deadly storms, a religious facility at sea gives shelter to people who have been affected by pollution, causing them to not develop proper legs. A priest at the shelter dreams about the sea goddess, who will try to destroy them for when humans have done to the sea; unless he can find a way to work with the sea with the help of the affected people.
