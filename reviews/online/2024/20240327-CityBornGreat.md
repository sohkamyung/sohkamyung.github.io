*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

An urban-fantasy story about a person who knows the city of New York well. Perhaps too well, for he feels he can sense the pulse of life in the city. This turns out to close to the truth, when an acquaintance tells him that the city is about to become alive, like several other major cities in the world, and he was to become the 'mid-wife' that will bring the city to life. But that has its dangers, for there are older beings out there who hate to see new life being born and will do all they can to end it before it begins. Thus begins his task to protect the city as it is being born, and to use his skill at 'feeling the city' to fend off attacks until the process it over.
