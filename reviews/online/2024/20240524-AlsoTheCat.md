The parents of three sisters with nearly the same age required them to share possessions and personalities since young. Naturally, they hate each other and left as soon as possible. But now they are elderly, and events has bought them back to their parent's house. As the sisters die, their ghosts remain tied to the house, arguing with each other. But perhaps the ghost of a childhood cat can show them a path to leave the house that would involve them acting in a way they haven't done before.
