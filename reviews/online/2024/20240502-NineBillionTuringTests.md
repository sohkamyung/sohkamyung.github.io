A story of an elderly man interacts mainly with the AI representations of his neighbours. But when the community becomes flooded, the man, with the help of his AI cane, has to learn to interact with people again to save himself.

The story contains interesting discussions between the man and his cane over the nature of sentience and emotions, especially over the loss of the old man's wife (before the story begins) and of his cat in the story.
