*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

A young girl runs away with two bank robbers to get back an item they robbed from an earlier bank. But the journey would be an unusual one, for the robbers make use of unusual roads to get away from the cops, roads that only one of the robbers can sense. As their relationship develops, the young girl takes on the task of driving the getaway car and getting a sense of the roads. But danger is never far, either from the police or from the possibly dangerous inhabitants on the roads.
