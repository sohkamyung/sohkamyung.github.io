*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

In this story, the protagonist 'doom-scrolls' through the postings on a social-media app. Only, instead of seeing posts by other people, he is seeing posts by himself in other universes. And the posts are uniformly depressing, with complaints by his alternate selves about their lives in the doldrums. But then, he occasionally sees direct messages from his other selves, asking him how he is. And when he decides to respond to one message, he discovers what may be the truth behind the app that is keeping him addicted to the social network, and what he may have to do to break out of the cycle of depressing posts.
