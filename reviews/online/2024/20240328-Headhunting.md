A private detective, who suffers from hallucinations, is assigned to recover the mummified head of a monk stolen from a cathedral. But things take a surreal turn when he tracks down the thief, who is now also suffering from similar hallucinations, only in a more severe form. The clues point to the stolen head. But time is short, for the thief escapes and returns for more of the heads, which may lead to humanity suffering from a shared, horrifying global hallucination.
