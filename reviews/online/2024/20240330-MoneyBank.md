*Story can be read on-line: <https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/money-in-the-bank/>*

*Rating: 4/5 Stars.*

The story starts like any other cyberpunkish tale: a notorious hacker/protector is hired to protect the body and assets of a major cryptocurrency persona, who goes by the unusual name of Mealybug, who is being doxxed and hunted by persons unknown. That would become important later on when the person is revealed to be not quite who we think he is, making it even more important that the person's life is saved to generate yet more cryptocurrency in safety.
