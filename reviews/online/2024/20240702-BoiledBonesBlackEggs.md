A fun story about a restaurant that caters food for the living and also for the dead. But one day, a dead and very boastful warlord arrives, demands to be fed, and does appear interested in moving on in the afterlife. His demands and insults chase customers away and the restaurant may have to be shut down. But the owner figures out a way to get rid of the warlord, figuratively and literally.
