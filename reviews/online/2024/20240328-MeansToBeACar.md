An AI car which serves its uploaded owner picks up a visiting passenger. That visit would gradually turn tense as the passenger has a grudge against the owner, and then violent. Events would then put the car into a dilemma, as it tries to serve both its owner and the passenger, which is at odds with its own priorities. Eventually something has to give, and the car must decide which one.
