*Rating: 4/5 Stars*

An interesting story of a woman who has raised her daughter and grandchildren, despite her first husband running away and the death of her daughter. Going on a holiday to Las Vegas, she encounters her ex-husband, who asks her for help. She reluctantly does so, only to be saddled with him again. The solution to the problem of getting rid of him again would involve a visit to a witch and a lesson for the ex-husband on being there when his daughter needed him.
