*Rating: 2/5 Stars.*

A story that didn't really catch my attention. It is about Evan, who suddenly begins to cough up bones, in a purportedly haunted house. Weirder things begin to happen when his partner leaves him and then eventually returns to find him in another relationship of a different kind.

*Story read from 2024/06/01 to 2024/06/03.*
