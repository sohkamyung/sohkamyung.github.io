A sculptor, famous for his portrayal of lions, is commanded by the king to produce a battle scene featuring the king triumphant on the battlefield. Being a loyal subject, the sculptor does so. Only he keeps hearing rumours, especially from his nephew in the army, that the king may not be as brave as he is said to be, and his battles may not be so victorious after all. But what is a loyal subject to do, if not do to as the king says?
