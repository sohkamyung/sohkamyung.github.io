*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

A dragon who travels the rail system is constantly harassed by the major and his security, who in turn fights back. Their conflict irritates travellers, who rather just use the dragon to get from A to B. Eventually, the dragon and fellow travellers decide the only way is to compete to become mayor, which leads to all kinds of social and public media subterfuge. Eventually, both the mayor and the dragon meet to debate, which ends rather abruptly, leading to a change: perhaps for the better.
