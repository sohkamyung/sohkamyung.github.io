*Rating: 4/5 Stars*

A fascinating tale that starts off as a slightly futuristic detective story involving a shocking murder of a family and a search for the missing mother by a detective. But it suddenly switches gear when the detective discovers that the people she knows and love don't appear to be what they are.

The two sides of the story are obviously connected to the reader, but it would require the detective, in her new state, to continue with the investigation and connect the dots before coming to the same conclusion and figuring out how they might be connected.

A fascinating story about dealing with a world that suddenly appears 'wrong' and working through the evidence to come to the correct conclusion.
