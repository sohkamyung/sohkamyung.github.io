In the future, Heaven is a digital uploaded copy of a person. And the company that decides who gets into Heaven is Ethical Empire, who employs people to look at people's lives and to give or subtract points.

The story concerns one such person who looks into the lives of others and gets involved in a romantic relationship with one of the engineers behind Heaven. But as the relationship develops and company secrets (under NDAs) get quietly shared between them, a disquieting revelation is made about the true nature of Heaven and how it may not really be what people think it is. At the end of the story, the main character asks to see her uploaded father and to judge for herself whether what he inhabits is really a kind of Heaven; or not.
