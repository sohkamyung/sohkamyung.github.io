*Rating: 4/5 Stars*

An interesting tale about a little Free Library set up for people to borrow and return books. One day, books are borrowed and unusual gifts are returned instead, like unknown feathers and leaves. Things take an ominous turn when books about building civilisations and weapons are replaced by unusual currency. Just who is borrowing the books, and to what end?
