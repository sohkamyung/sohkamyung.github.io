*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

A fantasy story set in a countryside bed-and-breakfast run by a woman who relishes the solitary lifestyle and keeps the place safe and sound by playing the bagpipes and walking the territory to keep the fairy creatures away.

Initially, this sounded like creatures from an overactive imagination but things take a turn for the fantastic when a returning visitor, whose wife apparently vanished at a nearby lake, suddenly finds happiness and the creatures that live in the lake may not be so imaginary after all. When the woman realises the significance of this particular visit, she has very little time to try to save the man from the creations of his own imaginations.
