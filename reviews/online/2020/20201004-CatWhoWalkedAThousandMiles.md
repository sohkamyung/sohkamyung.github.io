*Rating: 4/5 Stars.*

This is a lovely, light fantasy story about a cat in ancient Japan who loses her home and goes off on a quest for a new home, carrying with her the tales from her former home as told to her by the other cats that lived there. Through various adventures and encounters with people and animals, she gathers a host of new stories and discovers that the stories are what make a place you live in a home. And she does eventually find a new home, and becomes known as the Cat Who Walked a Thousand Miles.

The fantasy element is in believing that the cat can mostly understand what humans and another animals are saying. Otherwise, it's a straight telling of an adventure story from a cat's point of view.
