*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

A short story about a military AI faced with what it thinks is the trolley problem (faced with a choice, who should it kill?). The story doesn't offer a solution, but rather a way to talk to it, especially after it decides to cut off communications with its commanding officer over what it considers to be an insult to it.
