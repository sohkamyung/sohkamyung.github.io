*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

Chronologically set between the Murderbot books "Exit Strategy" and "Network Effect", this short short story is told from the viewpoint of one of Murderbot's clients. After having being held hostage, Mensah is suffering from mental and emotional issues from that episode, yet is unwilling to admit to anybody; except perhaps Murderbot who can see what is happening and encourages her to seek help. This is also a prelude to one of the story threads told in "Network Effect".
