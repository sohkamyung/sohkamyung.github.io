*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

A story that feels like a fragment of a larger story given the background information in it, it has a academic hustled to a military location to help figure out why 'improved' AI driven battleships are destroying themselves. The reason would have to do with the AI's sense of Self and what it means for an AI to be physically embodied in a ship.
