*Rating: 4/5 Stars*

An interesting story within a story within a story that starts with a storyteller sitting down among a group of people who are in Pakistan for a Comic Con. In each story, a character meets another character who starts another story. It is only by the fourth story to be told that all the characters in the previous story are tied together and their individual tales are revealed to be part of one grand tale about marital abuse, jealousy and magic that not only entrances the people in the story, but the actual reader also.

Best read in one sitting in order to keep the initial individual story threads in mind before the grand reveal at the end.
