*Rating: 3/5 Stars.*

A story that raises a disturbing question: what would a country do if it had a weapon of mass destruction and wanted to ensure that it would only be use by its President if said President was fully aware of the consequences not just in the abstract but feel the force of the decision by literally having blood on his hands?

Wrapped in this story of an awful dilemma is the story of a girl would is thrust into this moral conflict wholesale. In the end, as time passes and the physical conflict affecting the country becomes ever closer and more desperate, it would turn out to be her, and not the adults, who have to keep up the responsibility of being the one to decide whether access to the weapon should be granted or not.
