*Rating: 4/5 Stars.*

An interesting story involving the various small body parts of Joe, the soldier, which make up thirty-three percent of his body. Their task is to make him a good soldier, a task at which they are failing, for Joe is a miserable soldier.

Then, his Cybernetic Cerebral Control and Delegation Implant Module (or CC) gives him access to the camp's kitchen cooking machine and he improves the food (Joe wanted to be a baker). This would improve the morale of the camp and affect his efforts to be a better soldier.
