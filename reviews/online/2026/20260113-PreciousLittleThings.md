*Rating: 4/5 Stars.*

An interesting prequel to "Made Things", at a time when small living puppets are still in the tower of the wizard (now frozen in time) who gave them life. The puppets procreate by building more puppets using material they find (paper, cloth, wood, etc.) and using the wizard's magical aura.

But now a disruption appears in their little tower world. More wizards approach, knowing nothing of the puppets' world, but only desire what the wizard has. Now may be the time for the puppets to repel the invasion, and to go out into the wider world to survive.
