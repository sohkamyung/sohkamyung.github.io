*Rating: 4/5*

A fantastical tale of a time in the Carribean when the water has eaten away at an island until only one unusual mango tree, one person and one vulture bird are left as its inhabitants. The person begins an effort to preserve the island's language as its lexicographer while communicating with the bird and, later, a large snake. Both the bird and the snake would discover another inhabitant on another island and together, they have to decide whether to join the rest of humanity or stay on the island and see what the future holds for them as the new world gradually changes them physically.
