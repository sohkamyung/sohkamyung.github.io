*Rating: 4/5*

An interesting story of a drone who, while patrolling a designated wildlife zone, encounters a holdout: an elderly woman still living in the zone. Curious at first, the drone follows her home, while trying to convince her to relocate to the city. But it is while at the home, that the drone realises what the woman has been doing and now has to convince some rangers, who may forcefully relocate her, that she belongs where she is.
