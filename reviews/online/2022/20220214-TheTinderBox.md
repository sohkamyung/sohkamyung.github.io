An interesting follow-up to the fairy tale, "The Tinder Box" by Hans Christian Andersen. In this story, the beheaded witch from the original tale still lives and recruits others to her cause of disposing of the original soldier who took her tinderbox, who is now the King.

What is interesting in this follow-up story is that the witch was playing the long-game over the tinderbox, for what she wants is freedom for both her kind and for the people of the kingdom. The tinderbox (and her beheading) was a means to that end.
