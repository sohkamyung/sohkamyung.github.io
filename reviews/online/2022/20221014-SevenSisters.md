A tea farm in Mississippi is in trouble: most of its tea harvesting robots have broken down, the person at the farm who can fix them is down with a virus, and the tea leaves need to be harvested soon. Add to the troubles, one of the members of the tea farm family wants to introduce a new family member, who is a refugee. The troubles make one person consider breaking their pledge to stay together no matter what. But as the elder member of their group reminds them, being a family is the main priority.
