*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

A nice, entertaining 'episode' in a war between the worlds, featuring scientific nuns who spot an incoming invading ship from Mars and set out to destroy it and its 'munching people into mincemeat' occupants, as told through the eyes of a novice nun who gets her chance to become involved in the fight.

There is no preamble to the story, so be prepared to be dropped into the thick of the action as the nuns take on the Lurch. The history of the conflict and where it might go in the future is given in quick bursts as the nun's goliath war machine rushes to get to the scene before competitive druids riding trees (really!) to claim the bounty from the ship; if they survive the battle.
