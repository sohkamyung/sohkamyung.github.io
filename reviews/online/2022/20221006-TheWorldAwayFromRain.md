Set in a future where the world is recovering from a climate crisis that involved heat waves and very acidic rain, a young girl lives a protected life with her mother, who is dreadfully afraid of the weather. But an unexpected meeting with a turtle from the sea and people playing in the rain would make her urge her mother to come out again into the world that once ravaged her mother and father's lives.
