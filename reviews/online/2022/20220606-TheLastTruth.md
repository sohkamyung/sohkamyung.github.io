An interesting story about an indentured lock breaker on a ship who would be free after this final trip when she breaks the locks in the hold of the ship for her master, who steals the items. But to break the magical locks, she must tell a truth about herself to the locks, and each truth is lost to her in the telling. In this story, she meets a musician, whose music has the power to make people dance and possibly forget (or remember) themselves. Together, they plan to escape their indentured lives, but only once the thief makes one final effort to break an intricate lock with the last of her truths, and if the musician can help her remember herself.
