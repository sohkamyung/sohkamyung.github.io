An interesting story of a boy in a town whose routines are slightly askew (it's always summer, for instance) because the clocks that make time past are not measuring the passage of time correctly. Until a time-keeper comes to mend the clocks, and mend time.

But the boy's desire for a change in his daily routine makes him steal an item from the time-keeper, which he uses to make all time askew to get the time-keeper to return, so he may escape with him. But time has a plan of its own for the boy, which leads to a possibly inevitable conclusion about the boy and the time-keeper.
