*Rating: 4/5*

A touching story about a scientist struggling to create a new lifeform, via genetic manipulation, to grow in Mexico and elsewhere as the weather gets hotter. Additional strain comes in the form of her daily communications with her grandmother, who is slowly losing her memories. It would take a breakdown and more honest communication with her grandmother's stories for her to achieve the breakdown that would lead to a brighter future and a way to remember her grandmother better.
