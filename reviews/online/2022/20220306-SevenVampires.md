In this story, the vampire Judge Dee and Jonathan flee Paris (which is being purged of vampires). They meet up with another group of vampires to sail together to England to escape. But things do not look right from the start, when they discover one member of their group murdered. And the murderer is one of them.

As the group continue their journey, other group members are also murdered, and clues lead Judge Dee to suspect that the murderer is after an object of value. Only at the end is the object revealed which would appear to be a treasure to the vampire that gets it; or perhaps not, according to the Judge.

A light-mystery piece because the murderer would be eventually revealed as the victims pile up, but the relationship between Jonathan and Judge Dee are at the centre of the story: that and Jonathan hunger for good food.
