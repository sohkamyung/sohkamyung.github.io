On a spaceship that is still on its long journey back home after resolving a situation with an alien ship, Bot 9 has been reawaken by Ship, who has a new task for it. Bot 9 is to try to wake up a human member of the crew to talk to another group of aliens who only accept biological beings being in charge of ships, failure of which will cause the aliens to destroy the ship.

The problem Ship is facing are the other bots on the ship, who have now assumed the identities of the sleeping human crew and refuse to accept Ship's orders. Once again, it is up to Bot 9 to resolve the problem before the aliens arrive to discover bots in charge of the ship.
