A woman returns to her home planet, which features other intelligent species, only to find it in the grips of xenophobia. She finds and offers to send home her alien neighbour's daughter. But the journey back would be dangerous, as groups roam the streets looking for 'others' and she frets for the safety of the daughter and also of her children.
