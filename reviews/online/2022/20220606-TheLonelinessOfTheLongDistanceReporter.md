*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

A story about a reporter who goes to report on an unusual sled race in Norway that involves zombies. It starts out like an investigative story by the reporter but when the reporter takes part in the race to see where the zombies are going, the story takes a strange, surreal turn into possible paths taken by the reporter in her life that may, or may not, lead to her life being in the hand of the zombies.
