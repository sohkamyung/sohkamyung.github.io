An interesting story about the nature of fear. An artist catches the eye of a gangster, who now regularly buys her paintings. One day, the gangster asks her to paint a picture based on a photo of his favourite childhood memory.

But what she draws would be more than just a replica of the photo, and highlights the nature of fear: what she fears about her gangster customer, and what the gangster would fear about her painting.
