*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

An okay story that looks at the immediate 'life' of a girl in hospital that has been 'revived' from the dead (due to cancer) and the aftermath of that revival on the outside world.

A promising premise that does not quite deliver for me, for the revival is implied but never explicitly stated (it was not clear if she really was revived from the dead or maybe woken from a deep unconscious state after numerous operations). The effects of her revival on the outside world are only shown through protest crowds outside her hospital and in brief news scenes.

Perhaps the story would be more engaging if it was enlarge to encompass more of the implications such a revival would have on the girl personally and on the world.
