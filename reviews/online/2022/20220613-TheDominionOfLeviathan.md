*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

An okay story that, while 'Space Opera' in scope, is let down by a narrative that informs the reader of events that have (or will occur) off-stage, rather than letting the reader discover it.

In a written missive, the narrator tells the story of Lord Ajax, who rules over the Solar System and will not tolerate weakness and presumed treachery. She also tells the story of how she is discovered by Lord Ajax, transformed in an 'Ascendant' (basically a uber-human), undergoes trials, only to be arrested and punished.
