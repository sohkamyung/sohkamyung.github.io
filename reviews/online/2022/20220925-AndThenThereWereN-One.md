*Rating: 3/5 Stars*

Numerous versions of Sarah Pinsker from different multiverses get together for a convention on an isolated island. But when a murder takes place, it is up to an investigative version of Pinsker to figure out who did it.

As in mysteries of this sort, the clues are scattered throughout the story, and it might be possible for an attentive reader to figure out who is the suspect. But the motive is science fictional and would involve a yearning for living a different life, when the numerous Sarah Pinskers have already lived multiple lives.
