An interesting short story involving images that cannot be processed by people's minds, killing them. A 'punk' is assigned the task of putting up such images (with proper eyewear protection) in some areas to cause disruption, but it then goes wrong, causing him to be thrown in jail. As the law has not got around to legislating against putting up such images, he expects to be set free soon. But little does he know the insidious power of such images, even when seen distorted.

Memos inserted into the story offer explanations for how the images can 'crash' the human mind (like crashing a computer, unable to process data). Written many years ago, this is a concept that, hopefully, does not come true nowadays in the era of AI computer generated imagery.
