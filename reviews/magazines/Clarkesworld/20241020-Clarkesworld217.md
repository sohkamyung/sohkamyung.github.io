An average issue with interesting stories by Nigel Brown, Fiona Moore and Arula Ratnakar.

- "A Space O/pera" by Abby Nicole Yee: the Philippines sends up a dog into space. But a problem occurs, and the dog is left for dead in space. But her owner does not give up, and plans to rescue the dog.
- "The Buried People" by Nigel Brown: an expedition goes to the frozen north to dig up people who have the ability to hibernate and freeze during winter. The reason for this, and how these people may have got this ability, are hinted at in this story about a climate catastrophe that happened in the past.
- "The Children of Flame" by Fiona Moore: a community that sprung up after a civilization collapse now face a new challenge: a feudal group that wants to take over. It would need the community to realise that they need each other to face the challenge.
- "Fractal Karma" by Arula Ratnakar: a girl loses her job. Desperate to keep up her share of the payment, and stop being seen as a loser, she learns of and steals an experiment headset that allows the user to connect to the minds of another user. Intrigued, she forces her way into a study (which promises its volunteers a reward) being conducted with more connected minds, not knowing what she will get into. A rather mathematical story, featuring fractals and aspects of Borromean rings that tie into aspects of melded minds giving rise to another form of intelligence.
- "Fishing the Intergalactic Stream" by Louis Inglis Hall: a 'fisherman' travels from many worlds to catch their equivalent of fish. But a new, empty world presents a new challenge, for it may have been set to lure the fisherman instead.
- "Midnight Patron" by Mike Robinson: in a future where humans are no more and crows are more intelligent, one crow finds an abandoned house with images and a statue and, in a burst of imagination, sets out to create its own artwork.
- "The Face of God: A Documentary" by Dami√°n Neri: short pieces from many viewpoints on the discovery of a large alien corpse in space that many view as the body of god.
