*Rating: 3/5*

An average issue of Interzone, with interesting stories by E.G. Condé, Prashanth Srivatsa, Matt Hollingsworth and R. Wren.

- "Sibilance" by E.G. Condé: an investigator goes to Jupiter to discover why production of a vital source of fuel for fusion is diminishing. What he discovers would be an unexpected source of intrusion that can drive people, and machines, mad.
- "Warmth" by Seán Padraic Birnie: in a bedroom, a shadow moves in a way that shadows don't, and the occupant can only freeze in fear, or be warmed by the end.
- "Drafting" by Rachael Cupp: a teenager drafts a letter to a friend, first for hating her for stealing her boyfriend, then correcting it to maybe it is for the best, in a world where they are isolated from each other in shelters.
- "The Spirit Machines" by Prashanth Srivatsa: in an alternate past and future, two robots animated by magic guard a Buddha's relic from the relatives of a king who want to claim in. In the end, they fail; or do they?
- "When I Was the Red Baron" by Matt Hollingsworth: in a story containing violence and self injury, a young boy sees his father commit suicide, which has him rolling his crayon in the blood, which gives him chilling powers of destruction when used from drawing. As he becomes a parent, having used the crayon a few times to deadly effect, he is now faced with one final choice. But it may be his young son who might change his decision.
- "Carrigan" by R. Wren: an Irish person goes home to the farm where he/she grew up. But having to deal with relatives who don't know what to make of her is the least of her problems when her uncle accidentally awakens ancient people from the bog. Now they need to be appeased to leave the land alone.
- "The Clockwork Heart of Heaven" by Roby Davies: a fantastical story about a mechanical deity born from the mind of a man who might go on to dominate the earth and absorb humanity in its quest for godhood. But not if one man and a team of intelligent primates can stop it in time.
