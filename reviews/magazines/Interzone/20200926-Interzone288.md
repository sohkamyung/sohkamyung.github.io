*Rating: 3/5.*

An average issue with interesting stories by Alexander Glass and Gary Gibson at the start and end of the magazine.

- "Time's Own Gravity" by Alexander Glass: creatures are loose in the land; creatures that feed on time. And only one man can apparently stop them. But who is he and does he have his one agenda and use for the creatures?
- "Soaring, the world on their shoulders" by CÃ©cile Cristofari: in a country at war, one person is tasked with bringing to life a flying creature to aid in the war. But the person disagrees with the purpose and hides while the creature develops and hatches, looking for another way for it to be free.
- "A Distant Hum" by John K. Peck: a woman goes to to a man to learn of a secret: that an apparently abandoned and disconnect weapons system in a city is still very much alive. And she has plans to use it for her own purposes.
- "Captured Dreams of the Dead Machine" by Daniel Bennett: in a future where a computer virus has devastated many systems, a man hunts down ancient movie files that have survived. But his latest find may land him in trouble with raiders who prefer the present to the past.
- "Warsuit" by Gary Gibson: an interesting story of a scavenger in a warzone who, hiding from a hunting machine, goes to hide in an abandoned combat suit that turns out to be still working and with the download personality of its former occupant. Through a series of arguments, we learn the background of the scavenger and also the suit and how they learn to act together to save one another.
