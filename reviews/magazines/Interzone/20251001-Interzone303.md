*Rating: 4/5.*

An interesting issue of Interzone, filled with 'weird' stories that stretch, but not quite, break credibility and only Interzone stories can. Good stories in this issue by Nathan Brown and Sasha Brown, Corey Jae White and Maddison Stoff, Humphrey Price, Eygló Karlsdóttir and Ashley Stokes, and Giselle Leeb.

- "The Chainsaw Surfer Against the Army of the Deep" by Nathan Brown, Sasha Brown: an accurate title for a fantastical story of an army from the depths of the ocean that rises to conquer New York, and it may be up to one surfer with a chainsaw on a surfboard to save humanity.
- "Do Motorcycle Centaurs Dream of Five Stars and a Tip?" by Corey Jae White, Maddison Stoff: a weird, but fun story of a 'centaur', an organism merged with a motorcycle, that makes a living delivering food. But its job may be cut short when a new company with a faster delivery system arrives that may render it obsolete. Then, a hostage situation gives it a chance to fight back, when the hostage taker makes a food delivery request: the delivery race is on.
- "Project Star Train Final Report" by Humphrey Price: the final report, written on a manual typewriter, of a mission to send a series of probes to a nearby star, the discovery of intelligent life on a planet orbiting the star, and the resulting mess that occurs when information was transmitted that would lead to a technological backlash.
