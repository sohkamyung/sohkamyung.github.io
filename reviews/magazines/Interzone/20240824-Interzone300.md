*Rating: 3/5.*

An average issue, with interesting stories by Lyle Hopwood and Noah Lemelson.

- "Hate: A Genealogy" by FÃ¡bio Fernandes: a somewhat meandering story of a person who, after an attempted suicide attempt, gets recruited into an organization that polices alternate times and places by transferring their consciousnesses. This gets wrapped around a story about him planning to kill his father, which does not appear to get resolved.
- "Joanie from Rupture to Rapture (Once Again Under the Spotlight)" by Carlos Norcia: a story of the journey of a musician through space.
- "Fables" by Rachael Cupp: a series of fables with morals as told in a shelter after the end of the world.
- "Swim With the Space Whales" by Lyle Hopwood: a private investigator is hired to find a package that goes missing during a transit in space. But things get serious when the investigator's companion ends up dead during another investigation, and they may be linked together, along with some intelligent space whales that aren't really whales.
- "The Complete Expiration Records of Nebu Inc. Colony KE-4-01" by Noah Lemelson: an interesting series of scenes of a mining operation on a planet that goes seriously wrong when the planet's native lifeforms turns out not to be as harmless as originally thought.
