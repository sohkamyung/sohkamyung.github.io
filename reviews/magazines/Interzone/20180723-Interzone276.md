- "P.Q." by James Warner: researchers investigating ant nests discover some nests piling together structures with no apparent purpose. Investigating them would reveal the structures may be related to the way the ants sense the world through scents and chemicals, and perhaps to store knowledge. But the ants would be threatened by approaching fires unless something is done to save them.
- "Throw Caution" by Tim Major: prospectors on Mars converge on an area discovered to have Martian life: a crab that has a jewel embedded in them. But the pickings are few and hard to come by for a new group unless they take a chance during a storm and chase after the crabs and discover their purpose.
- "So Easy" by Bonnie Jo Stufflebeam: in a dying country, a mother and child make a final journey to the sea to end it all.
- "Eyes" by Paul Crenshaw: a fascinating tale told by a pair of eyes found in a stream one day by a boy. Gradually, the boy learns the story of the country where the eyes come from, where eyes are passed down from parent to child over generations, gathering knowledge as the eyes see the world.
