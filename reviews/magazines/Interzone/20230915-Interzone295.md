- "Plague Dream" by Se√°n Padraic Birnie: in a world full of crisis and plagues, one person is isolated from others and yearns for contact, including from her recently deceased mother.

- "Hollywood Animals" by Corey J. White: a touching story of a future where Hollywood animators have unionized for higher pay, leading film studios to do the 'obvious': create and train genetically engineered animals as aliens instead of getting artists to render them on screen. But one animal trainer has had enough of the animals being 'disposed' after filming, and a strike gives him the opportunity to do something about that, even if it means losing future work with the studios.
- "Copper" by Jendia Gammon: a robot main accidentally reveals a secret to its owner. And now both have a lot to talk about.
- "The Fifth Horizon" by Nozaki Mado, translated from the Japanese by Cat Anderson: in an unusual future, Genghis Khan now rules the steppe grasslands in space. But even here, doubts gnaw at him about the future. But a companion shows the way for him to see all the multidimensional grasslands.
- "The Lunar Asylum" by Frank Dumas: a 'steampunk' alternate future where famous scientists from the Victorian England era group together to send the first rocket to the moon.
- "Supernaut" by Edward R. Morris: another alternate future story, involving one Hugo Gernsback becoming involved in another version of Amazing Stories and looking at the changes wrought by a different version of World War I.
- "Notes From the Meeting of the First ~~State Feder~~ World Court: Walker Dairy, Freeville, NY, ~~198~~ Year One: Jessica Jane Pearson Vs. ~~The Stranger~~ Mr. Jacob Hampton" by Rachael Cupp: in a future where a calamity is hinted to have happened, children run a trial with the court records being rewritten as the trial proceeds.
- "Building Blocks" by Aigner Loren Wilson: an unusual person from a moon travels to the Earth to join a group of people building homes. Their (singular) abilities are noted by others, who are puzzled over his fixation to work.
- "Strung Along in Seaforth" by Jonathan Laidlow: a story about a man who enters a strange competition with an unusual life-like model of his dead father, sewn together from the skin of the father's cadaver. He had been denied the top prize in the competition by a rival for years but now has high hopes to win it, with some collusion from others, both alive and dead.
