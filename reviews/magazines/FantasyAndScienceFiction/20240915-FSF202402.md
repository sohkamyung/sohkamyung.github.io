But they have no choice, and come up with a desperate plan that, with some last minute changes, may yet work.
- "Snowdrop" by Raul Caner Cruz: an old couple fashion a child out of snow. Then, like in fairy tales, the child comes alive. But there is no fairy tale ending, as the child will have to cope with their passing and decide on what to do next.
- "Dog People" by Esther Friesner: a humorous story involving goddesses from several mythologies on an outing in New York City, suddenly finding that the dead have escaped from Hades' Underworld. Sending them back and finding out what has happened would lead them to discover a side to Hades that they never saw before.

- "Growth Rings of the Earth" by Xinwei Kong: a story of a future Earth where most people have become digital uploads. One of those that are not uploaded finds his work as a librarian taking care of printed books fulfilling. But one day, he meets a person who has returned from an upload, and gets a promise to meet again to read a book he will write before he dies. That day arrives, but other events would affect what the librarian will do when he becomes the last person left on Earth.
- "Jacob Street" by L. Marie Wood: a short, horror story of a couple who keep getting lost on their journey past that street, with their GPS telling them they are now at the bottom of a bay. But it is really a GPS mistake?
- "Red Ochre, Ivory Bone" by Deborah L. Davitt: an unknown artifact approached a space station with various alien races.

- "Slickerthin" by Phoenix Alexander: on a Greek island, the inhabitants share it with harpies, who give their eggs to the islanders to be eaten. But they fear that one day, they will get an egg with a 'deformed' harpy (or slickerthin), which they have to care for, despite its deformities. The day has come, and the person who has to take care of the slickerthin wants nothing to do with it. But the harpies have ways to make sure the job is done; or else.
