# Soh Kam Yung's Github Website

## Introduction

Hello world. Welcome to Soh Kam Yung's website, which is produced usng markdown syntax and served via Github Pages.

This website contains my book reviews (fiction and non-fiction), fiction magazine and on-line short story reviews. It may also contain other items, depending on what I want to do with this site.

This website is always a work-in-progress. Expect things to unexpectedly break from time to time.
