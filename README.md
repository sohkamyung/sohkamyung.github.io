# Soh Kam Yung's Github Website

## Introduction

Hello world. Welcome to Soh Kam Yung's website, which is produced using markdown syntax and served via Github Pages. The Github repository for this website is at <https://github.com/sohkamyung/sohkamyung.github.io>.

This website contains my reviews of books (fiction and non-fiction), fiction magazines and on-line short stories. It may also contain other items, depending on what I want to do with this site.

This website is always a work-in-progress. Expect things to unexpectedly break from time to time.
